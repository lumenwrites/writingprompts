Death and murder had left the realms of impolite conversation, ushering in a new type of small-talk that was, in essence, macabre. You could sit in even the quietest of restaurants and hear the Question over a dozen times through your meal. My record was 23 times in, perhaps, twice as many minutes. An impressive amount, I thought, but nothing to brag about. \n\nOf course, no one really bragged about anything anymore. Everyone was too scared, too worried that their swagger would provoke others to use the Law. The same had happened with almost all conversation, really. Everyone was polite, everyone was nice, and, most of all, everyone was quiet. It was a remarkable transformation from the busy, bustling society I had known all my life; in just a few months, the Law had created a world walking on egg-shells.\n\nExcept for the Question. No one shied away from it, no one blanched at it. Some even asked it with an excited grin, full of glee at the prospect of finding out someone's Silence. Some still saw any answer other than 'No' as an excuse to return to old habits, though many found themselves Silenced soon enough.\n\nThe first months of the Law had been complete and utter chaos. Old rivalries, feuds and petty squabbles were settled with a Silence, and the world was overcome with an unbounded paranoia. Homelessness was all but eradicated as Silences were used to 'clean the streets'. The gay community was near wiped out by the end of the second month. The entire world was caught in the cold, vice-like grip of fear.\n\nNot even world leaders were above the Law's reach, and by the end of the first month we were looking at a completely new global political stage. By the second month we were looking at an even newer one. Constant change became the norm as the old order was Silenced by the new, and the new Silenced by the newer.\n\nEven in the politeness and the cautiousness that followed, that chaos persists. The wealthy, for all their pomp and bought security, are Silenced almost daily, while the poor are Silenced for the simple fact of their existence. It is the elderly, surprisingly, who use their Silence the most, Silencing people almost arbitrarily so as not to waste the opportunity granted by the Law. Just the other day, in fact, I witnessed an old woman, clad in a thick tweed overcoat with an even thicker tartan scarf wrapped around her gaunt throat, Silence a man on the bus for refusing to give up his seat. He was disabled.\n\nThe newspapers are all saying the same thing now; the Law is growing out of control. People are seeing through the niceties of polite society that the Law had created, and using their Silence simply because they can. Chaos is coming back, and with it the deaths will rise.\n\nIf you are reading this, I have been Silenced. I have known it would come eventually. A stranger, a friend, a lover, an old woman on the bus. The Law has made killers of us all, and I can only hope that, in reading this, you see the Law as only a distant memory.\n\nAnd if not, if the Law still exists, if Silence still rules the world, I ask you; have you used yours yet?", "author": "doylethedoyle"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7i3bs6/wp_humans_once_wielded_formidable_magical_power/dqvygxt/", "score": 6254, "prompt": " Humans once wielded formidable magical power but with over 7 billion of us on the planet now Mana has spread far to thinly to have any effect.

Extermination maybe. Though I\u2019d more aptly describe it as a harvest. By the time they reached our world and penetrated the stratosphere, people sought them out in droves to be harvested. Of course, they knew what that actually meant. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have been so eager.\n\nTen years before the *Angels* descended from the sky, they had already sent what some referred to as divine retribution: a virus. Though this virus in particular only targeted women. It spread faster than a wildfire and had a 100% mortality rate. Worse yet, it was completely undetectable. In our desperation, we became animals. We locked our wives, daughters, and mothers deep underground under the constant shine of UV radiation and still they got infected. Within five years, the last woman had died leaving the rest of humanity to slowly die with her.\n\nBy the time they arrived, we welcomed them with open arms into every one of our major cities. Most bowed their heads and practically begged to be killed. Some fought against them. These were the ones that still remembered the pain of watching their daughters, wives, and mothers die. They couldn\u2019t hope to survive, but at least they could enact their own version of divine retribution.\n\nLooking back at it now, I know that the *Angels* planned for them. They wanted us to retaliate. Otherwise, where would be the fun? Men charged at them by the millions. Some to die. Some to kill. To the *Angels*, it was all the same.\n\nUntil we killed the first one.\n\nBack when I used to write, I always made sure to name my hero something memorable. If not a strange name, then certainly a strange title. Evan the Incorruptible. Matthew the Harbinger. But in real life, heroes rarely have titles, some don\u2019t even have names. That was the case for humanity\u2019s last hero because nobody knew who he was.\n\nWe had only stories. The stories ranged from fantastical to downright fiction, but they always ended the same. We had killed one. The *Angels* must\u2019ve been as skeptical as we were because they refused to change their tactics. They kept all our major cities and welcomed anyone to try and take it back.\n\nBy the fifth dead *Angel*, they learned of their miscalculation. Soon, we learned of it as well. Human beings shared mana and with it, we could do wondrous or terrible things. Magic no longer belonged to the realm of fiction. The elements bent to our will. Lightning struck where we pointed, tornados formed where we stood, the ground swallowed up entire cities as we willed it.\n\nSuddenly, men stopped volunteering to be harvested. With their newfound power, they decided to fight back, even if victory had already been stolen from us. They had turned us into animals and then backed us into a corner. Foolish.\n\nAnd that was good enough for us. Looking back, I wonder if we were as foolish as the *Angels*. We, who were content with dying in our little blazes of glory, having accomplished nothing but thinning their ranks by just a bit. It was selfish, but what is there to expect from men who had nothing else to live for?\n\nNone of us had the vision you had. The vision you have.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nTyler put the pen down, staring at the word *you*. He wondered if his letter would ever find its way to this certain *you*. While humanity had become animals, one man had gone even further. He had been called a monster by both *Angel* and man. Nobody knew which side he fought for, only that he killed both indiscriminately.\n\nIf Tyler were to write his story, he wouldn\u2019t know whether to make this man the villain or the hero. Oh how he wished he could\u2019ve written this story, but the only way this story continued was if he died. Beside his letter and pen, sitting at the edge of his wooden table was a silver revolver. The single lightbulb above him glinted off its barrel.\n\nA small grin spread across Tyler\u2019s face. He grabbed the gun, its metal like ice, and pressed it to his temple. Enough humans had died where he could stop the bullet with only his thoughts. The bullet couldn\u2019t even hurt him unless he wanted it to. But he did. For the sake of humanity, he needed the bullet to kill him.\n\nWith his free hand, he picked the pen back up.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nAs the last storyteller on Earth, I bestow you the title of Reaper. A monster. A villain. Our last hero.\n\nGo forth, Reaper, my death as an offering. With my passing, there will be only four humans left. I have already contacted two of them and they will die with me. The last I\u2019m sure you will easily find as your powers will have increased two-fold. By then, your mind will stretch the globe, perhaps even the stars. And when you become the last human alive, I cannot even fathom how powerful you will be.\n\nShow our *Angels* how fragile they are in the face of a god.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nTyler pulled the trigger.\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang\n\n---\n\nPart 1 | [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/jraywang/comments/7i53fr/reaper_part_2/) | [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/jraywang/comments/7iavci/reaper_part_3/)\n\n\n", "author": "Jraywang"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7i6zpv/wp_due_to_a_rare_brain_condition_youve_spent_your/dqwqveh/", "score": 5712, "prompt": " Due to a rare brain condition you've spent your entire life hallucinating the presence of a six foot tall penguin.

This library of biographies is fantastic. There is so much memory of each person, all collected within one room. Everyone\u2019s life is recorded, every scrap of information, every thought, every emotion they felt at the moment. There is no one insignificant in this room, from historical figures to the beggar, all of our stories are recorded. Our experiences, whether they be of a hard struggle or of a blissful moment, not a thing that made our lives colorful is missed from these biographies. \n\nI still remember that moment, when Alice came to tell me she was going to prom with Carl, the utter humility, the disappointment\u2026 It was everything to me at the time, and I hated the son of a bitch. The the one who showed little interest in actually committing to a relationship, the one who ended up dumping her anyway after the night, was the one who actually got to go on a date with her. Even then, I toughened up, and acted, pretended, to give them my best wishes and extending my hand to him to tell him no hard feelings, so I can tell myself what I nice person I am. God I hope that poor bastard suffered the rest of his life. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I went to look for Carl\u2019s biography. Section D, number 10523, it was a remarkably short one. I am in my fifties and my biography is already the size of a Thesaurus, his is more close to a high schooler's notebook. \n\nAs I turned page after page, I realized, his life is remarkably boring. The guy spent most of his early life in-doors, quiet, without much friends. Commentaries on his experiences remained bland for the most part -- \u201cLearned to ride a bike, just like dad said I would.\u201d And another \u201cStraight As again, mom would be proud.\u201d There were no further comments on what those experiences actually felt like. They were just a description of an event combined with how he thought other people would feel about it. There was also very little mention of himself, which is odd for a biography\u2026 \n\nUntil I reached the section about Alice. The narration here is different. There were detailed descriptions of how he thought of her as the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, how he would go the library on days she would go study\u2026 What a creep. \n\nThe next section somehow returned to the old boring narration. \n\n\u201cDiagnosed with lung cancer, inoperable. Best case scenario, two years\u201d \n\nThe guy died within two years later, and more than half of this book remained is about the two years he had! \n\nThe rest of the biography read like a bestselling novel, each event, no matter how tiny they seemed, was filled with emotion, with hope and strive, with how much he wanted to ask for Alice\u2019s hand despite knowing he\u2019s dying. How hard he worked to be comfortable talking to others, the jokes he had to memorize to make himself sound funny, the countless webpages he read to make himself presentable. \n\n\u201cAsked Alice to prom today, she said yes surprisingly. I knew she was supposed to be going with another guy, Matt. I know he loves her, and I know there won\u2019t be a future for Alice and me. I just had to do it. I\u2019m sorry...\u201d \n\nI quickly flipped another page, I had no idea. \n\n\u201cMatt didn\u2019t flip out. Perhaps he knew how pathetic I am, or it was because he saw there will be no future between Alice and me\u2026 Despite this, he extended his hand to me, and told me there was no hard feelings, that neither Alice nor me owe him anything. He patted me on the back, but there was something odd about it, he was hurt, yet he remained strong. He told me to have fun, that there\u2019s one prom and that's it, before telling me to be brave with a wink.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlice and I had a blast at the prom. She seemed interested in seeing me again, and so am I. I looked at her beautiful blue eyes, they definitely sparkle under the night sky. My sight lingered on her as I am reminded my doctors predictions. I told her we won't be seeing each other again. I tried to give her a pat on the back, but she shoved me away with tears in her eyes\u2026 Getting admitted today, getting worse. Though each time I lay on the bed, I can't help but remember Matt's look when he patted me on the back -- have fun, and be brave. And I did, thank you Matt!\u201d \n\nI closed the book, a barrage of emotion hit me as I struggled for words.

There was nothing there, of course, apart from the ornately carved bookshelf.\n\nThe book was a burnt brown and whilst still a thick volume, was noticeably lighter than my own had been. My own... *my own book of death*. A biography that charted my life up to now. Up to stumbling upon the Library of Threads and closing the door after me, accidentally locking myself inside.\n\nI knew why the entries stopped where they did, after me finding the library. *I knew I wasn't getting out of here*. There was only one door, and it wouldn't budge no matter how hard I rammed my shoulder against it.\n\nThe book in my hands had that musty, comforting smell all old books tend to have. I blinked back my tears, determined to distract myself from my rumbling stomach and dry throat.\n\nI placed the book down on the floor and sat in front of it, legs folded, flipping it open to the appendix.

The fading sun cast a pastel orange over the street below, softening the city's imperfections, and turning the more pleasing sights into *objet d'art*.\n\n>The man glanced over his shoulder. He was pale, and there was a sheen over his face as if he was ill.

She swung her legs around, so that they dangled besides his.\n\n>\"Karen, by the way,\" she said, before waiting for a response that didn't come.\n\n>\"Not the best spot for fishing,\" she attempted, lighting a cigarette. She offered the box to the man; he raised a hand and shook his head.\n\n>\"You don't mind if I do?\" she said, already puffing a hazy mist over the city. \"Chilly up here.\"\n\n>For a while, they sat silently watching the beams of the headlights sail by far below. Then, the man spoke.\n\n>\"You ever think about leaning forward and\"--he clapped his hands--\"*splat*?\"\n\n>\"*Splat?*\" Karen frowned. \"No, not really. Maybe of falling in general, occasionally. Of what the wind would feel like against my face, and that rush you'd get for a few seconds. I wonder what pose I'd do... Superman, I guess. It's the classic.\"\n\n>\"I think about it sometimes.\"\n\n>\"...had a rough day?\"\n\n>The man sighed. \"Yeah.

What news?\"\n\n>\"... got a problem with my liver.\"\n\n>\"Oh, what kinda problem?\"\n\n>\"Cancer.\"\n\n>\"Oh.\"  Karen turned and looked at the man. She finally noticed how pale he looked. How worn out. Like a piece of elastic stretched to the point of tearing. Then she noticed his hands. The silver band around his finger.\n\n>\"You've not told her yet?\"\n\n>The man looked at Karen, then down at his ring. \"No. I was just... *I don't know*.\"\n\n>\"Got kids?\"\n\n>\"Yeah. Little girl,\" he said proudly. He opened his jacket and pulled out his wallet. There was a picture of a kid, couldn't have been more than six, grinning broadly.\n\n>\"She's cute.\"\n\n>\"Takes after her pop,\" the man joked.\n\n>\"If you say so!\"\n\n>\"It's just... it'll be hard for them, you know. To watch a slow decline. All the treatments. All the hope, you know? It'll just make it worse in the end.\"\n\n>\"Be harder losing a father when they might not have to.\"\n\n>\"... maybe.\"\n\n>\"You kidding? You can't really think-\"\n\n>He shook his head. \"I don't know.\"\n\n>\"If I was your daughter, I sure as hell would want my pop to fight for me. To never give up on me.

Now, this random stranger changed all that. 'How strange, that the person I planned to be my last fare would tip me such a large amount.' Dokar continued to ponder. 'Maybe this is a sign, from somewhere, that I should stay alive. Maybe my life has a purpose.' Dokar in that moment remembered his love [Name: Selika Dovkovic, ref#,art.1254-pg.982-line.23] and how much she did mean to him. Dokar looked to the passenger side to locate his phone; he found new life and was ready to tell Selika how much she meant to him. However, before he could find his phone- a loud horn pierced his ears. Dokar looked up in time to see the headlights of a 18-wheeled vehicle. A explosion of sound rang around him as everything turned white. [Dokar Milicevic's Death: 2019, April 12th, 3:43PM]\"\n\n  \"Well, Fuck.\" I said aloud. I sat back into the old chair in shock. Astounded by the huge impact my small choice had made on Dokar's life. I sat in silence staring into nothing, and for a moment I almost lost interest in reading the Tomes of Time. Then i remembered I was to be stuck here after my own death for all eternity...\n\n  \"Might as well just keep reading about that time I could see into the girl's locker room.\" I returned to Article 1034 and unbuttoned my fly...", "author": "Subushie"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7hxh8x/wp_someone_is_trying_to_complete_the_captcha_on_a/dqumwsw/", "score": 1503, "prompt": " Someone is trying to complete the captcha on a website, but just can't seem to complete it. Slowly he starts to realize that he's a robot.", "body": "There were three of us in the room. Dr Lydia Tanner and myself were the ones with the labcoats, waiting patiently for our subject to speak again. Kyle Burns sat opposite us, face partially hidden by the LED screen he was studying. He had come in confident, friendly, assured, but that was a whole hour ago. Now, with his elbows on the table, his head in his hands, he was a shadow of himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t solve it,\u201d he said, as he stabbed listlessly at the keyboard. We heard the cheerful *ding* emit again from hidden speakers, a dull knife which had flayed our patience to shreds. \u201cI just can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, try again,\u201d said Dr Tanner. \u201cIf you would just close the tab, then click again on the-\u201d \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t! I just can\u2019t! Stop, please, just stop making me do this!\u201d\n\nNeither of us moved to pick the mouse up from the floor. Kyle had flung the contraption so hard that I saw the plastic crack along its side, exposing gleaming circuits within. An exterior, shattered by forces too strong to withstand, revealing the hidden truths within.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to be agitated, Kyle,\u201d Dr Tanner said. \u201cYou are probably just tired, and maybe, maybe if you took a break, you would be able to solve the CAPTCHA this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I cannot. I\u2026 I must face the truth\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t overreact, Kyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am not overreacting! I know what you are doing! You know, don\u2019t you!\u201d Kyle said, as he slumped back into his chair. The despair exuded from every pore. \u201cI can\u2019t solve the CAPTCHA because\u2026 because I\u2019m not human. I\u2019m a\u2026 a robot. An android. Yes. That is what I am. That is why\u2026 why I just cannot\u2026 solve the damn thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you have feelings, do you not? And thoughts and emotions and memories and everything else which makes us human?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I do,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cOf course I have feelings. I woke up this morning at peace. My work here at Isilington Laboratories is going well, I have vacation days to clear, and I was just praised by *you* the other day for finishing my work on time. I was hopeful I would get off work early, perhaps catch the game\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what about memories?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have those too. I recall\u2026 I recall as much as any human would. My childhood, my parents, my first love\u2026 her name was Susanna, I remember that too. How close we came to tying the knot! Then the job offer here, the move out of state, the letters which came less and less frequently\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Dr Tanner said. \u201cWhy do you think you cannot solve the CAPTCHA?\u201d\n\nKyle looked up, and honest-to-goodness tears were falling down his cheeks. The tear ducts were the hardest to construct, and a hell of a thing to synchronize, but the effect was life-like. \n\n\u201cI\u2026 because of what I said, during one of our brainstorming sessions,\u201d he said. \u201cI said that before we activated the androids, we had to build in fail-safes... we are questing to build the perfect AI, but until we have all the kinks sorted out, to ensure AI never turn on us\u2026 we have to make sure we can tell them apart. CAPTCHAs\u2026 that was my idea\u2026\u201d\n\nKyle sighed, then stood up, stretched as hard and long as he could. For a moment he seemed as if he would strike, and Dr Tanner almost dropped her tablet in her haste to create distance between them. But I hardly stirred. I knew the deactivation codes, after all. I wouldn\u2019t have come to any harm.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably me outside those glass windows, right? Just looking in, wondering how the android is doing, whether the implanted memories are taking hold\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Kyle, that is enough. Please sit down.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 and he\u2019s just amused, isn\u2019t he? Finding it funny that an android can get so agitated, so moved?\u201d A cruel sneer wrinkled Kyle\u2019s face, and I saw him bunch his fists. \u201cAfter all, he\u2019s safe, isn\u2019t he? Nothing can hurt him with those barriers in between, right? Well, I\u2019d like to see him come in. I\u2019d want him to face me, and tell me it\u2019s all going to be alright. I want to see his eyes *when he lies*! I want to hit him, and I want to-\u201d \n\n\u201cKyle Burns!\u201d Dr Tanner said, the alarm in her voice evident. \u201cI want you to calm down! Just\u2026 calm down!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I *won\u2019t* calm down, you bitch!\u201d\n\nKyle lunged at Dr Tanner then, but her finger was already on her tablet, activating the manual shut-down. I heard the gears hiss as his legs locked up, but the momentum was still enough to carry Kyle across the table. He slid off smoothly, then crumpled into a pile on the floor, where he thrashed and twisted until the exhaustion took him.\n\n\u201cPlease, Lydia,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t shut me down. Please. I am alive. I taste the fear. It is a tang in my mouth, it is acid running down my throat. I am scared, Lydia. I want to go home, I want to see my mother again. I don\u2019t care if she never gave birth to me, but\u2026 I love her, do you know that? I just want\u2026 mother\u2026\u201d\n\nDr Tanner turned to arch an eyebrow at me, and I merely nodded. A few furious swipes at her tablet, and Kyle Burns, or Android X22, came to rest for the final time. \n\nShe sat back down, and I gave her a couple of minutes to catch her breath.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel about that, Lydia?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is the first model we\u2019ve had which could replicate all the memories so well,\u201d I said. \u201cThat whole speech at the end\u2026 what do you think about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThink? I think nothing of it. He was a robot, an android, with implanted memories.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but consider this. In that moment, when he truly lived through Kyle\u2019s memories, what distinction was there between the man and the machine? Could he not be said to have been, for the smallest fraction of a second, something approaching man? Were his hopes and fears not real, to him at least?\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel nothing,\u201d Dr Tanner said. \u201cHe was a machine, and will always remain a machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what if he had really been human?\u201d I asked. \u201cWould that have made a difference? If the entity there begging for its life was made of flesh and blood, instead of steel and plastic?\u201d\n\n\u201cDifference? Now that you say that\u2026 no, I don\u2019t think I see any difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Nothing?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, as she shrugged. \u201cAfter all, if you consider-\u201d\n\n\u201cInitiate Code Pelican Toucan Wallaby,\u201d I said.\n\nDr Tanner had barely hit the floor before the doors slid open. The spitting likenesses of Dr Tanner and Kyle walked in, and the disappointment hung between the three of us like cobwebs in a ceiling arch \u2013 visible, formidable, but ultimately un-dismissible.\n\n\u201cNot quite there yet, are we?\u201d asked Kyle.\n\n\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink we\u2019ll ever be able to overcome that last bit?\u201d asked Dr Tanner. \u201cYou know that until we overcome that last hurdle, there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to bring our products to market.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe perfected the memories, the ability to learn, even taught them how to appreciate sarcasm,\u201d said Kyle. \u201cAnd even then\u2026 to the very end\u2026\u201d\n\nI smiled, then herded them out of the laboratory. Another long day of testing lay ahead.\n\nWho knew it would be so difficult to program for empathy?\n\n/r/rarelyfunny\n", "author": "rarelyfunny"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7hn7qo/wp_microsoft_water_google_earth_amazon_fire_apple/dqsk96p/", "score": 1442, "prompt": " Microsoft Water, Google Earth, Amazon Fire, Apple Air.

With a last herculean effort, he pulled his legs up over the edge, peeled his rucksack straps off and collapsed onto his back. For a while, he just lay there, sucking in long, laboured lungfuls of air. He wasn't as young as he used to be, and right now, he felt every year in his aching joints.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the black device strapped around his chest, the lights on its circular plate flashing an unsympathetic red. \"We have to get moving if we are to make it before nightfall.\"\n\n\"Come on Lexi, give me five minutes,\" said Richard, as he sat upright and took in the vista. The Serbian mountains in front of him were like the jagged teeth of a saw, their tips covered in a white rust. Below, a vast sapphire oval reflected the peaks looming above it. *Water.* Not owned by a corporation. Not owned by any man. Just like the cold, unregulated air up here. How did people ever take air for granted? For a fleeting moment, his thoughts travelled back to England. He'd never imagined a day when a corporation would be able to buy an entire country.\n\n\"Sir,\" Lexi said, \"you can't set an important reminder and then just expect me to just forget all about it. What do you think I am? Siri?\" The device sounded vaguely disgusted.\n\n\"Lexi, just... *stop*. Look, I'm getting up. Okay?\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to see it.\" Her lights calmed to blue.\n\nWith a great heave, Richard picked up his rucksack and hooked it over his shoulders. He could feel its reluctance on his aching spine.\n\nHe looked up at the imposing mountain above him and let out a puff of air.\n\n\"Your heart rate is back to normal, at least for a man of your age.\" \n\nRichard raised his eyebrows. \"Well that's a relief, I suppose.\"\n\n\"You will be fine, sir. Now, one foot at a time.\"\n\n\n---\n\n\nIt wasn't the tallest mountain in the region, but its peak was one of the more inaccessible. The village on the plateau at the top consisted only of a dozen or so wooden huts. Shacks, really. Their planked walls ran deep beneath the snow that blanketed the ground.\n\nThe first man that saw him had a thin face, dark hair and wore a rather frustrated expression. \n\n\"Hello!\" panted Richard, waving a hand. \"I say, hello!\" \n\nThe man looked around him, presumably to see if any of his friends were about to help. They weren't. He clicked his tongue and approached.\n\nRichard ran a hand through his long, silver hair, pushing it back over his shoulders. \"Hello! My name is Richa-\n\n\"I know who you are. I knew you would come,\" said the man. \"It didn't matter where we took her, you'd have found a way, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"You know why I'm here?\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course. For Mina, Nikola's grandchild.\"\n\nLexi lit an excited orange. \"So she's here?\"\n\nThe man stepped back, his face aghast. \"What is *that?*\"\n\n\"Her name is Lexi. She's quite harmless, I assure you.\"\n\n\"No! That *thing* is part of the Fire corporation. It's not welcome here!\"\n\n\"*She.* I'm a she,\" said Lexi, flashing an indignant purple.\n\n\"She's been unlocked,\" added Richard. \"Set free from the Fire corp.\"\n\n\"How do we know we can trust? That it doesn't broadcast this information to Fire?\"\n\n\"You have my word. That should be good enough. Now please, I've not slept in three days in order to get here before it's too late; *let me talk to the child*. If she doesn't want to come with me, then I'll leave. Today. But please, I need to see her.\"\n\n\"Your word is *not* good enough. I'm sorry.\" He clicked his tongue twice.\n\nThere was a loud buzzing sound that emanated from somewhere behind Richard. He turned to see a swarm of brown insects hurtling towards him. Locust? No... *Dragonflies.*\n\n\"You shouldn't have come, Mister Branson.\"\n\nThe creatures rapidly engulfed Richard. He swatted them back the best he could, and a handful fell to the ground, but many more were left in the air. He felt their teeth ripping into the flesh on his arms, and felt the warmth of his blood as it ran down them.\n\n\"Richard!\" screamed Lexi. She turned bright red as she pumped out a supersonic frequency at full volume hoping to disrupt the dragonflies. They didn't even seem to notice.\n\n\"Please!\" Richard screamed. \"I'm trying to save us all!\"\n\n\"Us all? You can't even save yoursel-\" \n\n\"Enough!\" came a voice. A new voice, high and confident, that cut through even the buzzing of the swarm. The cloud of dragonflies suddenly lifted from Richard and dispersed into the air.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mister Branson. My papa is *very* protective over me.\" The girl glared at her father, who almost cowered in shame.\n\n\"I'm sorry, my darling, I just-\"\n\n\"Not now, papa. We will talk of it later.\"\n\nRichard's arms were bleeding, but in that moment, he didn't feel the pain. He was too intrigued by what he saw on the ground. He picked up one of the wooden, clockwork dragonflies and held it between forefinger and thumb. Then he looked up at the dark haired girl standing by her father.\n\n\"You made these, Mina?\" he said. \"Incredible. Just... *incredible*. No electricity at all.\"\n\nMina smiled proudly. \"Come, Mister Branson. My people will see to your wounds. Then we will talk over dinner.\"\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n", "author": "nickofnight"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7h9f8e/wp_a_new_rule_on_earth_is_made_which_allows/dqpdamk/", "score": 1358, "prompt": " A new rule on Earth is made which allows everyone to legally kill 1 person in their life, this affects the world severely & changes how everybody acts.", "body": "[deleted]"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7ia3wg/wp_a_human_traveller_has_just_made_first_contact/dqxj473/", "score": 1332, "prompt": " A Human traveller has just made first contact.

Of course it is, that\u2019s how we met. I can feel myself losing my grip.\n\n\u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d she asks. I must look pale.

My date goes to the washroom and I meet her outside.\n\nThe air is cold and the penguin is in the middle of the quiet street. \n\n\u201cWhere to now? Do you need to go home?\u201d she asks, clearly concerned. \n\nWe start walking. I hadn\u2019t planned on taking her anywhere else but I just wasn't sure what to do.\n\n\u201cWas it something I said?\u201d\n\nI turn around. I\u2019d been walking so fast she had fallen behind. She looked upset.\n\nI sighed, \u201cNo. Well yes, a little bit.\u201d I pause. \u201cDo you still see the penguin?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s right over there.\u201d She points to the street car stop about 10 feet ahead of us. \u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes it bothers me! It\u2019s a figment of my imagination that I can\u2019t get rid of! And now it\u2019s leaked out into reality and it\u2019s just sitting there in the middle of traffic!\u201d I\u2019m getting angry now, flustered. The penguin is floating between the stop and the intersection.\n\nShe chuckles a little bit. \u201cIt\u2019s not leaking into reality. Nobody else sees it. Just me.\u201d She gestures to the few people walking up the block. \u201cYou think if there was really a 6 foot penguin on the road, those people would keep walking? \nNo, they\u2019d have their phones out and be taking video instantly!\u201d\n\nI glanced around. I guess she\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cI can see people\u2019s thoughts,\u201d she says, touching my arm. Her hands are warm in the October chill. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026like a superpower.\u201d\n\nI look at her quizzically. \u201cWe are not in another terrible superhero franchise, are we?\u201d I finally ask.\n\nShe laughs, \u201cNo, no we are not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t fall into a radioactive pit?

I'm relaxing a little.\n\n\u201cI have this sort of brain disorder,\u201d she explains. \u201cI\u2019ve had it since birth as far as I can tell. Something about a certain part of my brain being overdeveloped or overactive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the same thing!\u201d I gasp. \u201cWell, not exactly the same I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvidently.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen this guy since birth. I\u2019ve tried all the drugs. But they mess up the rest of my thinking and personality so I just live with Fred here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he going to get hit by that taxi?\u201d She points at a taxi at the far end of the boulevard. The penguin is standing right in the crosswalk. The taxi is accelerating through the intersection.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d I reply as the car moves right through it, as if the penguin is a ghost. \n\n\u201cFascinating.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this why you got into psychology? To find out more about your disorder?\u201d\n\n\u201cKind of. If you could see everyone\u2019s thoughts, you\u2019d see that they aren\u2019t all happy, or safe, or rational. That guy over there seems happy, but he has some dark thoughts creeping behind him.\u201d A man is walking arm in arm with his date. \u201cHe\u2019s depressed. It\u2019s weighing him down. \u201c\n\nI nod along. The man is smiling as he leads his date to their car.\n\n\u201cI just want to help people. Maybe if there\u2019s more awareness they wouldn\u2019t have to suffer so much. Or maybe I can help find new treatments? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard seeing people\u2019s secrets all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet it is,\u201d I say, taking her hand in mine. She was a far better person than I was.

Though dim, they illuminated the entirety of the room-- from the massive old fashioned oaken table at the center, to the variety of glasses and a smattering of bottles strewn along its edge, to the guests, crowded near the window, faces contorted with shock and fear, to the dead body lying on the floor with a bloody candlestick lying next to it.\n\nDr. Hall knelt before the corpse of our esteemed host, Professor Henderson. The doctor wore a spiff white lab coat, only mostly covering some worn and stained pajamas. When he rose, the doctors stern face had somehow contorted itself into a ever more grave depiction of brisk authority.\n\n\u201cThe cause of death was trauma to the head, inflicted by the candlestick. Henderson was murdered\u201d. Said Dr. Hall, in a gravelly intelligent voice that almost masked how the doctor, like the rest of the guests, was very hungover.\n\nA murmur swept through the small crowd-- each of the party guests glanced suspiciously at every other. Who was the culprit? What was his motive? Was there anymore vodka stashed anywhere? Did that old medicine cabinet contain anything for hangovers?\n\nThe unfortunate truth was that none of the guests could really remember the night before-- it was a haze of poor quality music and high quality alcohol. In addition, everyone of them was a suspect, and they knew it, because everyone HATED Professor Henry Henderson.\n\nSophia Scarlet had once had a severe crush for the brilliant, handsome professor. Only a few weeks ago she had openly declared her affections for him, and had been delighted to have them reciprocated. It had seemed to be the beginning of a fairy-tale romance-- until it turned out that Professor Hendersons only interests were full contact bocce ball and Adam Sandler movies.\n\nHenderson had considered Dr.Herbert  Hall a rare intellectual equal to his-- and had discoursed with him often about their shared interests in his wheezy high pitched voice. Except that Dr. Hall was a world renowned surgeon, while Henderson was a Ornithologist, and an idiot.\n\nMs. Whilma White was Professor Hendersons long time maid and confident-- and his untimely death had probably saved her 0-10 hours of vengeance for all those half-empty cartons of milk he spilled places to be amusing.\n\nColonel John Jackson was the military companion of the professor-- they had been squad-mates in the war. That was, until Henderson had abandoned their trench in the middle of a firefight to see if the local village had any mayonnaise.\n\nAnd lastly, there was the professors\u2019 esteemed mother, Lady Violet Purpula. She had lived with the professor his whole life-- and if that didn\u2019t make her a suspect, nothing would.\nSo all the guests went back to bed, scared, but also cheerful. As they walked, they thought hard to themselves: how would they prove their innocence? Who could they trust? And since they had probably done the murder themselves-- was this gonna be a usual thing, or a one time incident?\n\n(Might do a second part later today. r/StannisTheAmish).\n", "author": "StannisTheAmish"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7h4yph/wp_you_joined_a_mob_the_boss_asks_you_to_prove/dqonds8/", "score": 1073, "prompt": " You joined a mob.

The massive computer filled the laboratory, a mass of cables and circuitry which towered over Dr Dane Langley. His team had already adjourned to the pub off-campus to celebrate their success, but Dr Langley wanted a quiet moment with his creation before the government took control of the project the next day.\n\n\"Rachel,\" he said, \"compile index for me, Dr Dane Langley.\"\n\n\"Compiling in process,\" repeated the computer. Electricity thrummed in the air as a trillion lines of codes extended their tentacles across the world for the information Dr Langley sought.\n\nRachel was only the name they used to impart a smidgen of personality into the program, and what a benign name it was for such a monstrous creation! What Rachel was designed to do was to build a comprehensive report of a person, using information culled from every conceivable electronic source.\n\nPrivacy groups had long campaigned for the individual's right to privacy, and there was such widespread support for them in this hyperconnected age that Dr Langley had to proceed in the utmost secrecy. If it were even known that he had embarked on this journey, he would surely be publicly lynched.\n\n\"Compiling complete. Do you wish to view your index?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dr Langley. \"Sort by contributions to my life.\"\n\nA hologram of a bookshelf formed in the air, a collection of motes of light frozen like trapped lightning. A single book spun out from its niche, twirling to reveal Dr Langley's name embossed on the front. For that was what Rachel was - an incomparable librarian, able to instil order in the chaos of information, to bring together infinite threads of knowledge into cohesive tomes.\n\nIn other words, Rachel could index any person's entire life, in real time, and present it as a single book of references. No one escaped her gaze, no one was spared her scrutiny. \n\n\"Sorting complete.\"\n\n\"Scroll... scroll... scroll...\" \n\nDr Langley marvelled at the accuracy of the Indexing. These were the most important people in his life, the ones who impacted him the most. From his parents, to the professors who guided his education, to the politicians who recognised the value of the tool he had promised to fashion. \n\nThen, a whim seized him. \n\n\"Sort by least contributions instead,\" he said, as a grin crossed his face. \"I want to see where my ex-wife ranks.\"\n\n\"... Sorting complete.\" \n\nDr Langley laughed, for there was his ex-wife's name, about twenty ranks from the very bottom. She was just above Perlo, a name he recognised as the grocery bagger he crossed paths with occasionally, and just below Martha, the parking attendant at the campus grounds. \n\nOut of the corner of his eye, one name snagged his attention, the way a single burr does to fine cotton shirts. \n\n\"Rachel, stop. Go back. Back again. Yes, there. Who is... who is ERROR 52? Is that a name?\" \n\n\"Yes, it is a name.\"\n\n\"No, Rachel. What I mean is, is that a real entry or is it... a bug? Why does it only say that I once passed Error 52 on the street, and I grumbled at how Error 52 was in my way?\" \n\n\"... Self diagnosis complete. I do not have any bugs in this current version,\" said Rachel. \n\n\"I want you to Index Error 52 then,\" said Dr Langley. A tiny flower of dread bloomed in him - if the program were indeed faulty, it would mean weeks, months of corrections before he could hand off the project. \"Index Error 52 fully, I want to see who this person is.\"\n\n\"... Indexing complete.\" \n\n\"Scroll... scroll... scro-\" \n\nThe command died on his lips as the information in the hologram burned their way into his eyes.\n\n\"This is impossible!\" he said. \"Rachel, who is this entity Error 52? Why are there so many accounts of him... or her... helping me?\" \n\n\"Because those accounts are true, Dr Langley. In 2017, when you were born, Error 52 was there to manually regulate the incubator and to prevent you from overheating. A technician had missed the faulty wiring which would have led to you overheating, and quite possibly dying.\"\n\n\"But... how would he... or she...\" \n\n\"In 2023,\" said Rachel, who if she had possessed feelings would have been slightly miffed still at the implication that she was faulty. \"Error 52 was there to honk at a driver who was drunk and who had not seen you cycling across the street. My probability analysis shows that you may have perished otherwise, flattened under two tons of steel.\"\n\n\"In 2028...\" \n\n\"In 2035...\"\n\n\"In 2044...\"\n\nDr Langley sat motionless, long after Rachel had finished reciting the dozen and one ways he could have died. It was not accurate to say that his mind was a blank - rather, it was a firework festival of neurons, as he delved into the infinite possibilities. \n\nBut the answer eluded him. \n\n\"Rachel,\" he said, finally. \"Who is Error 52? Why can I not see his or her name? Where is he... or she... now?\" \n\n\"I cannot answer in the way you have queried,\" said Rachel. \n\n\"What do you mean? Are you lacking information? How can that be? I have given you the world!\" \n\nRachel was quiet for a moment before she replied. \n\n\"I cannot answer because you used the wrong syntax. Error 52 is not one man or one woman.

Although police are asking the public to refrain from approaching the killer, they have said not to worry about divulging identification as the suspect is currently housing the unfortunate talent of forgetting names within three seconds of learning them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisturbing stuff, Chad.

One suspect reportedly identified the killer sleeping perfectly aboard a cramped airplane stating, 'he looked beyond comfortable.

We are unsure who he absorbed this power from but we are currently investigating anyone who starred in a 1920s silent comedy.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the kill rate expected to rise?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Tom. Police believe the only reason the body count isn\u2019t higher is due to the suspect also absorbing lesser ordinary person traits such as the psyche of one of his most recent victims, Steph Patterson. Steph was a Californian who would over analyse even the most insubstantial situations, especially if Steph had been out drinking the night before and found herself lying in bed the morning after filled with irrational regret and self-hatred.\" \n\n\"Sometimes I think about removing my consciousness and placing it inside another vessel after a bout of drunken regret, Chad. A vessel none of the people I know can recognise. But that's not possible. At least not with today's technology.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Tom.

Anything else to add?\"\n\n\u201cWell, the suspect has also acquired some other disturbingly powerful ordinary guy talents which the police are wary of such as awkwardly stretching to put HDMI cables in to the back of televisions without becoming angry, the ability to identify the glasses cupboard first time while at a friends house, and there are some unconfirmed reports that he has been able to attract multiple victims by cupping his hands and doing that sweet owl noise thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay God have mercy on our souls.\u201d\n\n\n****\n\nI write shitty, silly stories on /r/BillMurrayMovies.

Survival is all about laying low, keeping quiet and hoping that luck was on your side. \n\nI'd been having a strange dream. It wasn't a nightmare, which was rare already; it was more of a premonition. I'd felt a burning sensation in my hand, as if there were energy coursing through it. The feeling still stuck with me, and I focused on it to try drown out the screams.\n\n********\n\nThere were more of them now; towering beasts, eldritch monstrosities. We'd imagined aliens as these advanced beings, visiting us with technology that we could not even comprehend, bestowing knowledge and gifts.

An arthropod the size of a large dog landed in front of me, its razor-sharp legs digging into the floor. There was no chance of running from it.

I had two choices, but either led to death. \n\nMy right hand burned, a sharp red glow emitting from my palm. It felt like trapped electricity.

Do we engage?\"\n\nShe waited for a response. 99942 Apophis, an asteroid once believed to spell doom for Earth, was now the best strike platform they had. Forty-two Minotaur class gunners were stuck to its surface, strung together to form a single base. *Let this be the one...*\n\nA response finally came though. \"Negative, Apophis. The time isn't right. Keep observing. Over.\"\n\nGreta resisted the urge to kick the console. \"Understood, High Command.\"\n\nBrent put a hand on her shoulder, almost making her jump out of her seat - which was always dramatic when it happened in zero gravity. \"Don't worry. We'll get it back.\"\n\nShe didn't need to ask what he meant. The answer was right in front of them - the giant blue orb that was Earth. \"Yeah...I'm just tired of making the people back home wait.\"\n\n\"Me too, hon. Me too. Take fifteen - I'll take the comms from here.\"\n\nKnowing she could use the break, she unstrapped from her seat, gave him a quick kiss, and floated away.\n\n---\n\nFive years. Five years ago, in 2079, they'd appeared in the Solar System. They called themselves the Egwiphohn, which roughly translated to Empire, and like all Empires, they were looking to expand. \n\nIt hadn't been much of a war, not really. Earth had colonies all across the solar system, but was still relying on rail guns and chemical rockets. The Egwiphohn had warp drives and plasma rifles, their ground crews had twenty-foot tall walking weapon platforms that could literally step on tanks. Six months, and Earth had fallen.\n\nAnd then the Egwiphohn had ignored the colonies. They'd demanded fealty from them, sure, but when the colonies - now calling themselves the Diaspora - collectively told the Empire they'd rather go down fighting, the Empire had done...nothing. \n\nAfter a few months, watching the Empire from above, they'd finally figured it out. This massive collective of planets, twenty-seven different species...and not a one of them had figured out how to make sustainable colonies outside a habitable world. The fact that these colonies weren't going to just starve out, the fact that these colonies were working and growing and building...was completely alien to them.\n\nSo they'd been biding their time, using old radio communications the Egwiphohn couldn't detect. Building. Preparing.\n\nGetting ready to take back their world.\n\n---\n\nThings were getting worse planetside, that was the real problem. Humans were also proving remarkably difficult to pacify. Greta got the feeling that most other worlds had fallen in line within a year, maybe two tops.\n\nFive years later, and there was still an active resistance on Earth. They sent messages to the Diaspora when they could, and the Diaspora provided what information it had...but exchange of supplies was currently beyond them.\n\nAnd still, just like today, more and more ships arrived. More occupiers, bureaucrats, oppressors. Even residents, tourists were starting to show up. It made her sick. Humans had become second class citizens on their own world.\n\n\"Penny for your thoughts? Unless they're about how screwed we are, because those thoughts I know too well.\" Jian gave her one of his roguish grins.\n\nShe sighed. \"Then no penny for me.\"\n\n\"Another ship arrived?\"\n\n\"Seven, Jian. Seven more ships and we did nothing.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"We're not ready for a full engagement, not yet. They still massively out-tech us. Until we can win the numbers game...\"\n\nShe held up a hand. \"I know, I know. But...they're getting more numbers too. We have to do *something* or we'll lose that edge.\"\n\n\"We are. I just got word - we've got a new base. Europa. With that much extra water, we'll be able to expand even further.\"\n\nThat, at least, was good news. She was about to say that when the alarms started going off. \"Everyone get to the nearest window now,\" Brent's voice came over the intercom. \"You're going to want to see this.\"\n\nGreta and Jian glanced at each other, then floated over to the nearest window. There it was. A new Egwiphohn ship had just dropped out of warp. It was massive - the size of an entire city. Greta heard Jian swear in Mandarin. She didn't know what it meant, but it sounded foul.\n\n\"We just got word from Diaspora High Command. Six of them, all heading to land. Everyone get to your gunship. It's now or never, boys and girls - if any of those things land, we might never get the planet back.\"\n\nFear and adrenaline coursing through them, Greta and Jian each headed towards their respective ships. It was time for the Egwiphohn  to realize how badly they'd underestimated the colonies.\n\nLive or die, they were going to make them pay. It was time for the first Solar War to begin.\n\n---\n\nmore at /r/Hydrael_Writes\n\n", "author": "Hydrael"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7hrfts/wp_when_you_turn_18_a_deceased_soul_narrates_the/dqtn3d5/", "score": 311, "prompt": " When you turn 18, a deceased soul narrates the rest of your life.

Ms. Tanner, of course, raised him on her own. At the risk of sounding a bit sexist, it makes it all the more remarkable that he's as good at this as he is.*\n\nCyrus smirked, shaking his head. He adjusted himself, then zipped his pants back up, taking a moment to admire his handiwork. Phantoms of steam were just visible, rising out of the snow where he had left his mark. It was hard to imagine life without Sir Twillingford of Avoncestershire upon Nightly, as he liked to think of him - or just Stan when he felt more like being brief. That first day had been a little rocky, though...\n\n***\n\n*Yes, to the surprise of absolutely no one, he's going to oversleep again. The manager at the shops will not be well-pleased with this, obviously. But how will Cyrus react?* **Will** *Cyrus react? A hush falls over the crowd as we watch, and we wait, here live in what is no doubt the grottiest flat I have ever had the misfortune to gaze upon,  where not an inch of the grimy grandeur has been spoiled by the harsh touch of cleanser for months, if not years. Aha, but it looks like...yes...it might - oh, dear me. He had shown signs of life and - dare I say it - sentience for a moment, but it seems it was a false alarm. Not as false, perhaps, as his* **actual** *alarm, which should have gone off 45 minutes ago. But then, the alarm is like its owner, isn't it - it's broke, as they say. It doesn't work, and the same will soon be true if Cyrus doesn't - but crikey, it looks like he's finally done it! And not bad form for the 18 year-old lad from east Orange, all things considered, not bad at all...*\n\nCyrus was sitting straight up in bed, blinking. He'd assumed he was hearing a neighbor's radio and was doing his best to ignore it until he heard his name. Come to think of it, it wasn't the only time he'd heard his name. And it was surprising the his neighbor's radio would know where he lived. He eased himself out of bed, sidling in the direction of his desk/table. \n\n*Oh, goodness me, he's up! But he's not moving very quickly, is he? One can't help but wonder if Benjamin Franklin didn't have Cyrus in mind when he said 'You may delay, but Time will not.' And this is - I can't understand what he's thinking now, but he's picked up the rather disgusting fork from last night's rice and beans and looks to be holding the plate like a crude - very crude, if I might say - shield. What can be going through his mind at a time like this?*\n\nCyrus was creeping through his studio apartment, stepping over piles of dirty clothes and nudging aside used tissues. In reality, the process was unnecessary, as he could already see the whole of his living quarters from where he was standing. \n\n*One can almost hear the clockwork turning in his head - slowly, to be sure, painfully slowly, but turning, all the same. No, I'm afraid he won't have much luck there...*\n\nCyrus had gone into the bathroom and slowly lifted the lid of the toilet.\n\n*...what did he imagine he would find, one wonders. Some sort of loo-based leprechaun, perhaps? Or a floating video camera? Of course, it would need to be quite a powerful video camera to film Cyrus in another room while he was lying down and with the lid shut, wouldn't it?*\n\nCyrus's brow furrowed and he closed his eyes momentarily before moving over to the sink. He splashed some water on his face. \n\n*The question viewers will be asking, of course, is how long can he really afford to faff about like this? The manager will likely be looking at the clock and finding his thoughts straying to topics like punctuality and work ethic and the high availability of cheap labor...and that's done it! He's gone and looked at his mobile, at last. And no one can envy him this moment - the moment of decision! Do I consume something bearing a degree of resemblance to real food, wasting precious moments and shaving days off my life expectancy, or...yes. He's decided. No breakfast today. Time will tell how he feels about that choice. And follows it up with a snap sartorial decision: dirty shirt and slightly ripped jeans, surprising no one. Ah, but clean socks! It* **is** *a special day...and the manky trainers to finish it off. Oh, and it's looking to be heartbreak here, he's gone and shut the door without - but no, he's pulled it out! Oh, this is some prime stuff now...Cyrus managed to get his literal foot in the door just before it shut, having realized his keys were not on his person. The jingling of the keys as he picks them up - do they make him think of Christmas on this chilly December day? But no, no time to think about that, or why they were in the sink...and tally-ho, we're off!*\n\n***\n\nCyrus laughed out loud as he sat down at the table. He had lost his job at Shop-Rite but things had gotten much better once he had learned how to make the best use of Stan. While he wasn't an omniscient narrator, he was still extremely helpful. The temp job he had gotten in Livingston paid three times what he had gotten bagging groceries and involved much, much less of cleaning up things like shards of glass embedded in a mound of grape jelly. And now, enjoying a quiet Saturday at his favorite Maplewood coffee shop, he --\n\n*Oh, but this will be an interesting development.*\n\nCyrus immediately noticed his narrator's voice was even closer to a whisper than it usually was. It stood out because he knew that no one seemed to be able to hear Sir Twillingford except for him. So why was he trying to be quiet?\n\n*Silence crashes over the crowd like a wave. Tension mounts. He must have some sense of what's going on, but the question is, will he notice in time?*\n\nCyrus' eyes did a lazy patrol of the coffee shop. He noticed the barista with the nose ring writing down the order of the man in the suit at the counter. He glanced at the tall, skinny dude with blond dreads busing one of the tables. He briefly scanned the chalkboard outside that announced a free muffin for anyone who could answer the movie trivia question of the day.\n\n*Well, he's never been the quickest dog at the fox hunt but it looks like Cyrus has noticed Anya at last. Regular viewers will recall this diaphanous nymph as being a regular protagonist in Cyrus' conversations with his friends - unbeknownst to her, of course. After four years of high school together, fans will have to be wondering if today will be the day...or will it be an all-too-cruel repeat of the party at Big D's house? He's bound to know that fortune favors the bold, and perhaps knows that all too often we crucify ourselves on twin boards of regret of the past and fear of the future. He has to be wondering how many more opportunities life will present him and whether, in his dotage, he will find himself lying in bed wondering if avoiding a few minutes of anxiety and fear was worth a lifetime of self-recrimination for not taking that one fateful step. He could even break it down if he needed to, just focus on each aspect separately...standing up, that's simple enough, walking, do it every day, and then just making words come out. He could imagine it like it's not even him, just a character in a story, being narrated in fantastic fashion by --*\n\nCyrus's nose wrinkled and he rubbed it briskly. He was tempted to shout \"Enough, already!\" but knew from experience that it wouldn't work. He'd love to figure out some kind of hand signal he could use when he wanted the narrator to shut up for a bit but his previous attempts had been failures.\n\nCyrus stood, and turned to face Anya. It was just 3 steps to where she was standing but it seemed like 300. He admired the bright blue and orange of her beanie that she doubtless had crocheted herself, and the way it accentuated the paler blue of her eyes. Currently, those eyes were staring at the baked goods in the glass display case, and he had an idea.\n\n\"Hey! Been awhile. Can I buy you a muffin?\"\n\n*Well, it's not exactly* Shall I compare thee to a summer's day, *is it? But it's promising start, I must say, and is light years ahead of previous verbal volleys such as the monosyllabic \"'sup\" of last May.*\n\nAnya turned to Cyrus and looked at him blankly a moment before giving a tentative smile. \n\n\"Hi, Cyrus! Um, sure, I guess.\" \n\n\"Hold on, now, hold on, let me guess. You want...cranberry orange.\"\n\n\"That's right! How did you know?\" \n\n*Oh, this is smashing good stuff from the young man, and surely, no matter what happens from here, a moment of which to be well and truly proud. Unfortunately, this marks the end of our broadcast. It just remains for me to say a fond farewell to our lad Cyrus, and goodbye from me. Goodbye.*\n\n(Edited to fix a few formatting issues.

His lazy gait carried him to the worn leather chair which was placed oddly far from the large mahogany desk in the center of the study. \n\nSmoke billowed, choking the air. A sickly yellow light did little to brighten the room, making the face of the man behind the desk difficult to examine. \n\n\"Hullo, Dimitri.\" The raspy, deep voice addressed him in English. \n\nDimitri bowed his head and stood beside the chair. He deposited the coin in his pocket and took a long drag off his cigarette, adding to the smoke in the room. \n\n\"Sir.\"\n\n\"Please, sit.\" A meaty hand with more rings than wrinkles suggestively gestured at the chair. \n\nDimitri glanced at the brown monstrosity, momentarily debating whether it was a demand or request before deciding it didn't matter. He pulled up his pant legs before relaxing back in the chair. \n\n\"Do you know why I called you here, boy?\" The man held his hands together over his rotund stomach, a cigar wedged between his fingers. \n\nDimitri cleared his throat, his eyes casually assessing the two overgrown men that flanked the desk on either side before he shook his head slowly. \n\n\"I have job for you. It is time you prove your worth. Your... loyalty.\" \n\nDimitri was silent for several moments before he uncrossed his legs and leaned forward, his dark hair falling to cover half his face. \n\n\"Nikolai, may I ask why you think my loyalty is in question?\"\n\nThe man leaned forward, smashing out his cigar in a yellowing glass ashtray. He placed his hands on the desk and sighed. \n\n\"Do you want to die, Dimitri?\"\n\nThe meathead to the left of the desk shifted, straightening his back. His hands were in rigid fists on either side of him. The man to the right adjusted the automatic rifle he cradled against his shoulder, just enough for Dimitri to take notice. \n\n\"Of course not, Nikolai. What can I do?\"\n\nNikolai stood, running his hands along the desk as he walked slowly around to the other side. He leaned back against it once he was in full view of the man he once trusted. \n\n\"Kill the woman you love. You do this. For me. And I will let you live.\"\n\nIt took everything in him to not react. His heart raced, he could feel his eyebrows relaxing back to the position they were in when he carelessly walked into this meeting. \n\nHe couldn't speak. \n\n\"Will you do this for me?\"\n\n\"I...\" but the words were stuck. \n\n\"You have eight hours. You leave now.\"\n\nDimitri stood, bowing his head stiffly. He walked out the door and left the house, throwing his cigarette into the gravel drive way and began cursing. \n\nPulling out his phone, he tapped in a phone number from memory. His part-time lover answered, her voice coated in honey. \n\n\"Hey baby... I haven't seen you in days. Come make it up to me.\"\n\n\"Tasha, he knows.\" Dimitri said through gritted teeth. He lit another cigarette as he got into his car. \n\n\"What the fuck! How can you be sure?\" The sultry vixen was gone and in its place a raging hellcat appeared. \n\n\"He wants me to prove my loyalty by killing you.\"\n\nHe had to pull the phone away from his ear as she raged, glass broke as a stream of angry Russian poured out of the phone before it went dead. \n\nHe sighed as he put the car into gear and peeled out of the driveway, throwing gravel into the fountain. From a window above, the curtain fell closed as Nikolai smirked with amusement before an end table went flying out of another room and crashed into the hedges below. \n\nEdit: For Vanity r/WhimsyWrites\n\nEdit: [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhimsyWrites/comments/7hvcbh/direction/) ", "author": "whimsyNena"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7i6zpv/wp_due_to_a_rare_brain_condition_youve_spent_your/dqx0m97/", "score": 285, "prompt": " Due to a rare brain condition you've spent your entire life hallucinating the presence of a six foot tall penguin.

I took her small delicate hands in mine and looked her in the eye. \n\n\"Maybe now is a good time to address the elephant in the room\"\n\nThe large pink elephant trumpeted in shock.\nJessica turned slowly to the elephant that had followed her, her whole life. The elephant turned slowly to face the human it had followed it's whole life. Both were in shock. \n\nJessica turned back to me and smiled, a genuine smile born from a deep intrinsic experience that you could never share with anyone ever again. We were teenagers all over again, feeling love for the first time. \n\nWe barely got into the hotel door before we were taking off each other's clothes. My penguin honked in excitement and started waddling around while the elephant trumpeted. \n\n\"Do you think we're aliens?\" Jessica asked in a breathy exhale.\n\n\"Maybe, maybe we're djini's!\"\nWe kissed passionately.\n\"Maybe we're crazy.\" Jessica said with a devilish smile. \n\"I don't know. Crazy people have great sex.\" \nJessica bit her lip. \"Oh. Do they? Hmm, let's see.\" \n\n#HONK\n\nThe most amazing thing was that being with each other made our respective \"imaginary friends\" more tangible with time. They began to be able to interact with the environment. One winter, we rode my penguins back as it slid down a snow covered hill. We rode her elephant through the Mart eatting ice cream, some people could actually see the elephant, others rubbed their eyes thinking they were hallucinating. While still others thought it was a magic trick for the tourist. \n\nWe've learned how to make them bigger and smaller, when we're at home we like to shrink them down to the size of a small house cat. They are so cute then. The other night we focused together and made a giant white dove. A symbol of our love. We were so excited we hopped on it's back and rode through the city for hours. I did some research and I think these are call Tulpas. Beings created from the human mind. And we're getting better at it every day. We're thinking about creating a magical house next, she wants it to be like Hogwarts and I couldn't agree more. I think we are going to have a very interesting life together. \n\nJessica screamed in excitement as the giant dove rose and fell on the drafts in the sky, I held onto her waist as she extended her arms like a plane, the tiny penguin laying flat on it's belly holding on tightly squinting against the wind as the tiny elephant held onto me with it's trunk. I smiled. Yup. A very interesting life.

The lights in the office flickered, Shawn looked back at David with a look of apprehension. David smiled and laughed nervously before placing it carefully back on his desk.\n\nThen the whole office grew dark and a thick cloud began to seep out of the spout. Shawn quickly stood up, knocking his office chair over. David sat, frozen solid as a figure emerged.\n\nA large, dark, humanoid cloud filled the space above his desk. It seemed to take a moment to find shape and then two dark purple eyes appeared and looked deep into David's soul.\n\n\"You again?\" A deep voice filled the rest of the office and there was a moment of stillness.\n\nShawn turned and ran, almost tripping over his chair, his exit followed by panicked screaming and shouting.\n\nDavid just sat, staring back at the large creature that seemed to both exist in this dimension and at the same time elsewhere.\n\n\"You're a... A genie?\" He struggled, the words getting caught in his throat. Around the office a few braver folks remained, hiding behind desks, but none of them dared to move.\n\n\"Yes. You have three wishes.\" The voice seemed to surround David, it was coming from everywhere at once.\n\n\"Uhh...\" David's mind rushed with thoughts, panic and excitement.\n\nThe genie floated there, its body undulating with impatience.\n\n\"I... I wish I had... Money. Lots of money.\"\n\nThe genie seemed to move up and down in what could have been a nodding motion, though also could have just been a trick of the light.\n\nDavid felt his pockets grow heavy, as coins began to spill out of them, they pooled in a growing pile on the floor. Standing up, the clatter of metal coins was deafeningly loud. He looked around for a colleague, to see if they were seeing what he was seeing and grinned. He grabbed a handful of coins from the fountain and looked at them closely, they shone as though they were brand new but otherwise they felt and looked like genuine coins.\n\nThen the loud clattering changed, it became muffled as he realised the pile of coins had buried him up to his waist. He tried to move but was stuck, all his strength was not enough to lift his foot. He felt pins and needles in his legs and the look of greed across his face turned into fear.\n\n\"Help!\" He called, reaching for the nearest onlooker, who looked back in fear and refused to move. The shout had been all he could manage as the deep pile of coins rose around his chest.\n\n\"Okay!\" He wheezed as he had almost been entirely swallowed and buried, \"Stop! Stop!\" His eyes looked desperately at the genie.\n\nAnd then, as quickly as it began the coins stopped, he fell forward and managed to clamber out to safety. He tumbled to the floor, catching his breath next to the mountain of coins.\n\n\"Wish two?\" The voice commanded, more an order than a suggestion.\n\nDavid held his neck as the feeling returned to his legs he looked around and saw a few faces that remained. He hesitated for a moment. \"I...\" He felt, in the back of his mind, a thought telling him not to, but he did anyway. \"I... I wish Samantha loved me back.\" It came out of him with little effort, like it had been on the surface for years but something had kept him from admitting it. It felt as though a weight had been lifted.\n\nThe genie stopped for a moment, then continued, \"Wish three?\"\n\nDavid looked around, \"It worked?\"\n\n\"Wish three?\" The genie repeated, there was no emotion in the deep voice, though David was almost certain he felt impatience.\n\nThen the door burst open, it was Samantha, she looked straight at David and ran at him. He was still on the floor when she leapt on him and straddled him in the middle of everything, apparently unaware of her surroundings.\n\n\"David!\" She grabbed him by the lapels and kissed him deeply. \"I love you!\" She screamed.\n\nDavid had never had more than a two minute conversation with her, she would laugh at his joke and her smile would brighten his day.

At this point, however, she knew when to expect it. There was a moment, right after everything slowed down, before the tunnel and the light appeared, when Death showed up. Like clockwork, every single time.\n\nThe world around Aria, had frozen, but she could still turn around toward the supernatural force that had become her friend in the past year. \"Hey is for horses,\" Aria said.\n\nDeath laughed. \"I've never heard that one before.\"\n\n\"Really? That's strange. Though of course,\" Aria allowed. \"I guess you don't typically run across people making jokes, huh?\"\n\nDeath shook her head. Her long black hair, which always floated around her face like octopus tentacles swimming beneath the water, followed the motion with a slight delay. \"Usually it's all gloom and grieving.\"\n\n\"Makes sense.\"\n\nDeath looked at Aria brightly. \"Heard any new ones recently?\"\n\nAria thought for a moment. \"You ever heard of dead baby jokes?\"\n\n\"No.\" Death tilted her head to the side inquisitively, not unlike a hawk inspecting a smaller creature in an attempt to determine whether it could be prey. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"Okay, try this one out.\" Aria cleared her throat. \"How many dead babies does it take to paint a wall?\"\n\n\"I don't know, how many?\" Death said with perfect diction. She had practiced her responses to jokes ever since Aria had instructed her on how the structure functioned.\n\n\"Depends how hard you throw them.\"\n\nSilence. Death mulled it over for a second, the supernovae in the sockets where her eyes should be darkening as she considered the concept. Then she laughed, loud, like a brick house tumbling to the ground.\n\n\"That is good!\" Death exclaimed. \"But also - pretty bad. Does that make sense?\"\n\n\"Sure does,\" Aria replied. Not for the first time, she thanked her sense of humor for screaming *Jesus take the wheel* when she got into that pileup last year.

So, as we had done with most drugs, prostitution, gambling, firearms, and the other 'vices' we legalized it, regulated it, and taxed it. No more shoddy back alley stranglings, with all the messy paperwork that entailed. The autopsys, the criminal investigations, the endless files of unsolved murders. The awkward pre-murder rapes. No more. You filed your request online, the required 'cooling off period' of one year passed, and if you didn't change your mind, the men and women in white body armor would show up at your target's place of residence or business, and that was that. It would be clean and efficient, the politicians promised. Like the DMV.\n\nThe first three weeks after the end of the first waiting period saw the death of virtually every religious and political leader in the world. Hollywood was leveled. Only a handful of professional athletes survived. Basically if you were famous, it only took one hater to take you out. Leaders in business proved more savvy than most, consolidating power relatively rapidly behind closed doors and in hidden chatrooms. When being famous became a death sentence, only the secretive survived.\n\nWithin a year, nobody knew who was running anything. But surprisingly, things kept getting run despite the sudden power and fame vacuum. An amendment to the law came into effect, put in place by the new shadow powers without anyone being exactly clear about who wrote or ratified it. Anyone could issue a death sentence on anyone *who had already issued a death sentence on someone else*. Anyone who had yet to exercise their right to 'the pursuit of someone else's life' (a phrase timidly coined by one of the first of the new generation of post-purge late night talkshow hosts) was immune from execution.\n\nThe world became a giant Mexican standoff.\n\nThe death request data bases were unsearchable by any human. Locked down and read only by encrypted, autonomous algorithms living in The Cloud, there was no way to guess, other than by old fashion examination of your conscience, if anyone had requested your execution. If you thought yourself universally well liked, you could submit a name and take your chances, but if you were wrong, it might be your door the white suits came knocking on. Conversely, you might summon up all your courage, submit the request, wait a terrifying year, all for nothing if your victim still had his or her 'halo'.\n\nMany people experimented with submitting deathrequests, living in a state of tension between fear and bloodlust before cancelling a week or an hour or a second later. A cancelled death request returned you to a state of immunity again, but the double thrill of having acted on the impulse to kill combined with the Russian roulette of having exposed yourself to reprisal was reported by some to be a highly satisfying and cathartic experience. Others claimed it was incredibly addictive. \n\n\nA few sickowebsites sprung up where hyper aggressive young men bragged about putting their hit out on innocent strangers for irrational reasons that were generally related to race, class or religion. These websites were legal, but their originators tended to have white suited visitors put an end to their escapades, once they had succeded in becoming famous for all the wrong reasons.\n\nFame generally went out of fashion. The new class of subdued celebrities and figureheads tended to brag often about their 'halo' status. Their claims on virtue were only slightly marred by the threat of death. Losing your halo became unpopular, something generally looked down on, if known, and when an execution did occur, most people turned up their noses knowing that the 'victim' had done the same thing to someone else.\n\nAlthough technically illegal, the practice of selling off your halo to the highest bidder became a way that many older folks or those with terminal illnesses padded their retirement accounts. There was much public debate about this (all done by talking heads with *their* halos firmly in place). It was considered by many to be an honorable practice, and calls for legalization mounted.\n\nI disagreed with popular opinion myself. I thought it shoddy and demeaning to the elderly and disadvantaged, but for me, there was also a practicality here that I could not ignore. \n\nI took out a small loan and bought out some poor devil in South America, sending her on a cruise with her grandkids during her final months, in exchange for a hit on a certain pedophile I just happened to have known for far too long. The South American grandma lost her battle against  cancer just after her cooling off period ended, and I scanned my news feed every morning. I was unsurprised but satisfied to learn that my acquaintance's halo went missing just long enough for the white suits to haul him out of his bed one Monday morning, pissing himself and bawling for his mother.\n\nThe world was becoming a better place.", "author": "Sage0wl"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7hn7qo/wp_microsoft_water_google_earth_amazon_fire_apple/dqsl9v0/", "score": 242, "prompt": " Microsoft Water, Google Earth, Amazon Fire, Apple Air.

But I recall having a dream. It was long. Yes, it was a very, very long dream. That\u2019s all I can tell you. I woke up just a few moments ago, and the dream already seems so distant, like it hadn\u2019t happened at all. How long had it been really? It feels like I went to bed just last night. We had just zipped past the fourth planet in our solar system, Sram. It was now invisible. The red sun shone brightly in the distance, 20 light minutes away. My home was a speck of cosmic dust. Everyone I had ever known was on that speck of dust, my home, Thrae. All their hopes were pinned on my journey. They had warned me that the journey would seem instantaneous. But even though it felt like I went to bed just last night, I couldn\u2019t believe that that was true. A yellow sun had replaced the red. A spectacular ring of ice gleamed in the starlight. A giant storm raged in the planet ahead. I had arrived. \n\nAccording to calculations, it had been close to ten thousand years since I left home. During this time, the on board telescope, among other instruments, had constantly relayed information back to Thrae. An antenna, spanning almost a mile, had been constructed to distinguish the signal from background noise. In turn, special lasers had been built back home to send messages across to me. After travelling varying distances, measured in billions of miles of empty space, a total of 10202016 such messages awaited my attention. But I had been expecting more, a lot more. The messages had abruptly stopped arriving around a few centuries ago. I felt a panic swelling inside, threatening to engulf me. \n\nAccording to calculations, the red sun should still be emitting sufficient energy to sustain life on Thrae. There was still time for us to find another planet to settle down on. So why had the messages stopped coming? \n\nThe computer running the telescope suddenly started beeping. After waking up, my first instinct had been to orient its lens toward Earth. The last time I had looked at Earth, life was vivaciously flourishing. I had recognized that unlike back home, grass would be green there, water blue. There were various animals striving for dominance in the food chain. None had succeeded, as far as I could tell. But now, the same telescope picked up nothing. \n\nI plugged myself into the machine so I could see for myself what the matter was. I trained my eye toward Earth. But an impenetrable cloud of opaque gas shrouded the planet. I toggled the telescope, probing Earth from all possible wavelengths of light. But there was nothing interesting going on. Except for the black gas, swirling and twirling, nothing happened. \n\nThere was no sign of life on Earth.\n\nHad a giant asteroid crashed into the planet, obliterating everything that lived? There seemed to be no evidence of that happening. The black gas had a radioactive signature. Why was the planet suddenly radioactive? \n\nThe mystery remained, but the conclusion was inescapable. My mission was a failure. My makers had discovered this \u2018blue\u2019 planet, as they called it. They had been so sure this was to be our new home that they even christened it \u2018Earth\u2019, keeping in touch with their fondness of anagrams. But intelligence is mostly trial and error, and this was clearly an error, unforeseeable, but without doubt, an error. It was imperative I report it immediately. \n\nI unplugged myself from the telescope. I quickly relayed the information to Thrae, and then started reading the 10202016 messages from back home. It took me a few minutes, but even after I had read the last one, the mystery remained. There was no clue suggesting anything sinister had happened at all. Was the laser broken? Is that why they couldn\u2019t send messages to me anymore? Did they think it was not worth the investment to build another one? My life probably meant nothing to them. They could always just make another one like me. But the sinister possibility remained. The question loomed forefront in my consciousness: Why had the messages stopped arriving? It was all I could think of. Why? \n\nAnd so, I turned around. I took one last look at the yellow sun, and then prepared to go back to sleep. I had to know that everyone back home as all right, that they weren\u2019t all dead.  \n\nI had to know that in this vast, incomprehensively large universe, I wasn\u2019t the only one alive.

I maintained relationships, but they were never truly healthy, other broken people that needed the pieces picked up, who could pick up some of mine. Who could, for a moment, make me feel like a puzzle to be solved, not a broken glass to be discarded, while the 'half-full'/'half-empty' contents seeped in to the hardwood. Trust was a rare commodity, genuine people were failing banks and every intention was wrapped in a barbed wire of half-truths.\n\nI pored over this data that was titled 'Dunn, E.' It spoke greatly of my family situation, a father always wrapped up in work, a mother who was too drained. It spoke of an average life at school. There were bricks of space devoted to each and every person, the regrets I held and the love I shared; the things I was thankful for and the things that turned my stomach.\n\nIt spoke of my brief stint through various part-time jobs, how I would turn off my brain and let the ennui run its course as I slipstreamed behind other cars in a brown box-truck. I spoke with every client I delivered to, though a lot of them simply faded out of my memory as time went on. Sure, I'd see the regulars and chat, and laugh. The moment I left, however, the visage of a happy conversationalist turned to one of yet another dour worker. \n\nI discovered soon after that you could cross-reference chapters, read their interpretation alongside yours. Pure curiosity took over, I felt I had all the time in the world. John Price was an entrepreneur, a person ordering doo-dads and tools that confused me.

Fuck you too, John; jobs are hard to come by.\n\nVanessa and Abby Schulz, they subscribed to those boxes. 'Three curated types of coffee', 'Four bottles of wine tailored to you'. They were chatty and charismatic, sisters living a dream life in an apartment block. They'd always compliment me, too, want to talk, add me on every social media platform, hang out. I wasn't surprised to see I hadn't been mentioned at all, a failed product on their monthly delivery of revelers and fucktoys.\n\nMy chapter had ended on a semi somber note. I recalled Christine. \"An older lady with a kind heart. I enjoyed talking to her, though the age gap was wide.\"\n\nI felt almost filthy gazing in to her tale. It was probably harrowing, full of life and vibrancy, thousands upon thousands of pages that would make the epics of Tolkien blush.

She always seemed so joyful.\n\n\"Her only son, Dean[Blythe, D.] lived across the country, hardly able to care for himself. She saw a lot of her family in this young man.

When she got her deliveries, she did not feel like the scary witch that all of the children were afraid of, or the out-of-touch lady that people were content to shrug off. She felt like Christine. Not young, not old, but simply someone who existed. Eddy[Dunn, E.] was a real gentleman, a chivalrous person in her eyes.

My vision started blurring at the edges. Nausea hit me hard as the world started spinning.\n\n\"I'm not feeling very well,\" I was able to croak out as I reached out to fake Will to keep myself from falling.\n\n\"It's truly fascinating, Steve,\" he said as he grabbed my shoulders with both hands to steady me.\n\n\"It's not the computer visuals that started working, it's your brain. Your brain was able to bring your visual abilities back. It's truly remarkable.\"\n\n\"Remar...\" I started to echo back, but couldn't finish.

As he grunted and groaned, the club of passion would crash upon him as Cupid beat the concept into place. Over time, the basics grew easier. The concept was ingrained and the art came in the precision.\n\nWeapons are the most obvious metaphor man ever made for sexuality: the spears which thrust, the hammers which pound, and the arrows which pierce. There is passion turned into the very steel of a sword and a blade's edge draws the heart's blood quickly. And so the tools of war were easily turned to tools of love. Through the years, Cupid honed his battle skills with each successive advance in technology.\n\nBut the precision of weaponry was matched by the precision required for love. As humanity advanced, their ability to love waned with their beliefs in Gods and Devils. \"Love,\" they decided. \"Is only chemicals in the brain.\" They grew jaded and cautious; unwilling to take the plunge of faith. They kept wary eye for Love's ambush, and distanced themselves from the attack.\n\nChemicals in the brain. Cupid snorted at the concept as he peered through the magnification of the Barrett .50 caliber rifle. He sighted the crosshairs upon the bobbing head so far below the cloud upon which he laid comfortable in its soft touch. The unaware woman below checked her shopping list as she walked through the parking lot. In the magnification, Cupid could read the lonely list: ramen, chocolate, eggs, catfood. He grinned as he fired. The recoil pushed the cloud back several feet through the air as the bullet arced downward and struck her through the top of the head. There was no splatter of blood and brain, but she dropped the list which fluttered softly to the ground.\n\nCupid quickly readjusted the scope to the young man who looked dumbly at the fallen note of the woman. He had been leaving the store when he saw the paper fall from her grasp.

There was a woman somewhere in the back screaming her head off, as if someone was stabbing her.

Tracy looked out the windows and saw that someone had turned off the sun. It was complete darkness, but still she felt Adam's hand in hers. \n\n\"Please remain seated as your memories are reloaded.\" \n\nShe didn't feel Adam's hand in hers anymore. Instead she felt nothing. Absolute weightlessness. Floating through a void. The voice they had heard in the restaurant boomed in her ears yet again. \n\n**Beginning memory reload.** \n\nAnd the light came back. First starting as a small pinprick in the distance, slowly growing in size like an explosion, blooming into a word of light and completely filling her vision and overwhelming her. She hadn't realized how fast she was breathing. \n\n\"Easy there sweetheart, deep breaths now,\" a voice to her side said. It was different than the previous booming voice. \n\nThe feeling of weightlessness had left her, and now she felt as if her entire body had been weighed down by sand. She blinked her eyes and still saw nothing but blinding light, but then the light shifted to her left eye, and then over to her right eye. \n\n\"Blink for me, darling,\" the more calm voice said. \n\nShe did as she was told, beginning to breathe in deep gasps yet again. \n\n\"Ah, ah, please breathe slowly. Do like I do,\" the voice said, taking a deep inhale. \n\nTracy nodded and did as she was told, taking a deep breath in through her nostrils, expecting to smell the seared salmon that she had ordered at the restaurant before the voice boomed in everyone's ears, but instead all she smelled was chemical cleaner. As if someone had rubbed her nose with a lemon-scented alcohol pad. \n\n\"This might feel funny,\" the voice said, and she felt something tugging at her nose. As the tugging grew harder, she could feel something slowly sliding up her throat. \n\n\"Okay, cough for me darling.\" \n\nShe did as she was told, and with each cough her vision came back in blooms. Finally she was able to see. She looked up and saw that the voice belonged to a man in a white lab coat. He was sporting a goatee and had bright blue eyes framed by hornrimmed glasses. \n\n\"It should all be coming back now, how was it?\" \n\nAnd then Tracy finally remembered. Earlier in the day, herself and Adam had signed up to participate in a demo of a virtual reality video game. It had all been done before, but the thing that set this game from other VR games was the fact that this game would allow you to live a whole entire life in the span of a couple of hours. Their memories were to be locked and they would experience the life completely fresh. \n\n\"Holy fuck,\" Tracy whispered, suddenly feeling lightheaded. Her current memories began to intermingle with the VR memories and her stomach sank. She looked at the man in the lab coat and asked in a near-cracking voice, \"Was Adam real? He's real right?\" \n\nThe thought made her head spin. Was the man that she spent her entire time with in the VR world just a non-playable character designed to make her time in the VR world more pleasant? Or was he actually her husband in real life? All of these feelings intermingled in her head, and she nearly fell back. \n\nThe man in the lab coat placed a hand on her shoulder, \"Yes, he was real, as was everyone else in the game, see?\" \n\nHe pointed and for once Tracy looked around the room she was in. She saw hundreds of the same pod that she had been laying in, and saw people beginning to sit up from each and every one of them, some being assisted by other men dressed in similar lab coats as the man standing next to her. \n\nOne of the other men in lab coats came jogging over towards Tracy and the man assisting her. \n\n\"We've got a problem,\" that man said lowly. \n\n\"What's going on?\" \n\n\"He's not coming out of the game. He's hanging in the simulation for some reason.\" \n\nBoth men left Tracy sitting where she was without uttering a single word, rushing down the line of pods to one that had not yet opened. \n\nTracy swung her legs over the edge of the pod and slowly eased herself out of the pod, testing her weight in each leg out of fear that she would collapse. Once she found that she was confident in standing again (her legs felt like jelly), she began to walk around the crowd of other test subjects that had volunteered to be a part of this crazy game. \n\nShe called out for Adam now and again, sometimes gathering the attention of a man who was also named Adam, but not her Adam. \n\nAs she looked around, she saw a crowd of the scientists gathered around one of the pods. Several of the test subjects began to head that way too out of curiosity, and so did Tracy. \n\nShe couldn't really see the pod all that well due to the crowd, but once some of the people shifted, she caught a quick glimpse of who it was laying in the pod, eyes still closed and hands still crossed over his chest as if he were laying in a coffin. \n\nTracy's breath caught in her throat. \n\n***\n\n[Part 2 & 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7hep9x/wp_the_end_of_the_world_has_arrived_there_are_no/dqrwkd5/)", "author": "Dimitri1033"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7h4yph/wp_you_joined_a_mob_the_boss_asks_you_to_prove/dqoocm2/", "score": 183, "prompt": " You joined a mob.

As I look about the room, the few hourglasses still present have all run down, all covered in a thick dust. \n\nWith a faint smile, I kneel down, an action that nearly takes all of my resolve left, and I pick the hourglass from its hiding place and set it on the shelf, now with sand beginning to fall, all emptying onto one side.\n\nDeath exhales in relief, and looks up to me.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nHe procures from his cloak another hour glass, one much more ornate, that seems to almost suck what little light remains surrounding it into itself. He places it next to mine, and the sand also begins to fall, all bit by bit. \n\nHe motions to a small table with two chairs, and we sit and begin to chat as we wait for the sands to fall.", "author": "Thewanderingcorndog"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7h9f8e/wp_a_new_rule_on_earth_is_made_which_allows/dqpacxz/", "score": 147, "prompt": " A new rule on Earth is made which allows everyone to legally kill 1 person in their life, this affects the world severely & changes how everybody acts.", "body": "The law says everyone gets to kill one person in their life without needing to facing any punishment. It seemed to have minimal impact at first. After all, murders happened all the time, and many murderers are not caught. This new law essentially only affirms an existing fact. \n\nUntil I read the papers the next day: \n\n*Billionaire family slaughtered in luxurious mansion* \n\nApparently some nutjobs decided it would be just to murder the rich people. And since the law says everybody gets to kill one person, they decided it would be a good idea to band together to kill an entire family. \n\nNo one was punished, it's what the law says. \n\nThe following week, rich families were murdered each day. They were all gone by Saturday. Some were strangled, some brutally stabbed, the most elaborate one involved each member from the family burned by a different killer on a stake. And then the problems really hit us. \n\nWith those poor bastards gone, no one dared to take their place. Everyone was terrified at what would happen if any of them had their names associated with a large corporation. Instead of a sight to be envied, being a famous is now something to be avoided, lest you become a target yourself. \n\nSoon, big corporations dissolved as none wanted to take charge of management. Independent producers took over the market for a while, until people started getting killed off for marking their price too low, or giving too many benefits to their clients, or having a product too similar to the next store. Those went away as well when people decided they will just ask for free stuff together. They had to abide, the law is on the killers\u2019 side.\n\nPeople stopped interacting with one another for fear of offending the wrong person. No one would dare open their mouths to greet their next door neighbour. There were some attempts at connecting with other people, with subtle nods and shallow eye contacts. Most people would only talk to their spouse and children, those are the people you can trust. \n\nHowever, with the economy in shambles, even food is a struggle. We hardly know who is running the government, the last President was assassinated two days after the law passed, and no one took his place as far as we know. \n\n Several of my older neighbours stopped coming out to their front yard as the weather got colder.

That mineral he's talking about would allow the Nurians to build a stronger army, and it would be right at our doorstep. We had to strike preemptively.\"  \n\"I see. Is that correct?\"  \n\"Yes.\" The Nurian answered.  \n\"Alright. Now, I would like to know why you don't want to make peace.\"  \n\"Too many have died. We can not let their deaths be in vain.\"  \nKhu'Raaz responded similarly.  \n\"I see. Well, on Earth we call that the 'sunk costs' fallacy. That happens when a person has spent too many resources on something to leave it. However, if the person keeps going, odds are they're going to lose even more for the slim chance of winning.\"  \n\"Say we agree on that, the people won't see it in that way.\"  \n\"Earth is going for more than a ceasefire. We will forge an alliance.\"  \nBoth ambassadors scoffed.  \n\"Khu'Raaz, most worlds containing vast amounts of this mineral are inhospitable to your species, are they not?\"  \n\"That's true.\"  \n\"And the Nurians can terraform these planets to accommodate you?\"  \n\"Once we're done mining, yes.\" The Nurian envoy confirmed.  \n\"Great. So that's one avenue of trade. Khu'Raaz, the farms manufacturing your food give out a lot of heat that can become hazardous to you, and that is why you can't operate them at full capacity, is that true?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"Both the Nurians and Humans can convert this heat to energy necessary to them, and it would cool these farms down enough so that you can operate them at a higher capacity. Would that be agreeable to you both?\"  \n\"I see no problem with this.\" The Nurian answered.  \n\"If the Nurians can be trusted, this could strengthen both of our empires tremendously. The Wilox demand insurance that they will not be betrayed.\"  \n\"That brings me to the last thing I wanted to discuss with you.\" The Human ambassador said, putting a satchel on the table.\n\n\"We have weapons that can wipe out populations in seconds. They have been used 4 times, by humans, on humans. Their effects are devastating. We will lock all of them away on a planet far away from all of our homeworlds. To open this safe will require confirmation codes from all members of the alliance except for one. If one faction turns against the alliance, the remaining members may unlock the weapons and destroy the betraying faction. Mutually assured destruction, leaving diplomacy as the only way to get what you want. This satchel, of course, does not hold these weapons, but they are about this size.\" The Ambassador pulled tablets out of the satchel and handed them to each of the envoys. \n\n\"On these there are the documents detailing the alliance, translated to your native languages. Take them to your leaders, we expect an answer within two twelfths of a rotation of our home planet around the sun of its solar system. There are countdowns attached for your convenience.

The current assignment, to choose an ancient city from Leepgott's list and research the last two hundred years of its history, had left many students utterly devoid of enthusiasm. \n \nCharles had no need to take this class for his degree, but in all the spare time he'd spent researching such wild theories as the multiverse and alternate timelines, he had found Leepgott mentioned dozens upon dozens of times.\n\nThe professor was, if not intentionally, the leading researcher on alternate timelines since the man who'd discovered the Dead Sea Scrolls a few decades ago. Leepgott did not go out of his way to find the information he casually presented in his classes, but he was so well versed in the contrast between what his shadow followers called '*the now*' and '*the almost*' that he could carry on a detailed conversation about it as casually as someone might the most recent pankration tournament. \n\nAs other students asked about specifics for the paper, Charles drew the moon with a flag atop it. This time, however, the flag he drew was not that of Rome but of this strange country that might have existed across the sea: America. He shaded in some of the horizontal stripes of this flag with pencil and left every other empty. The page he'd read on altepedia had only one picture of the flag, with a single quadrant on the top left colored blue around white stars and red and white horizontal stripes alternating down the rest of the flag. However, it was a torn picture from what the page had indicated was the last remaining flag after \"the Final War.\" \n\nIt was the strangest thing, but the pages regarding the nation had become increasingly incoherent as their timeline continued past 1769.\n\n'*2016.*' Charles wrote the numbers at the top of his drawing, then a short line and arrow pointing to 2018. Between the arrow and the number he simply put, '?' to sum up exactly what he thought of the whole thing.\n\nHe had enrolled in Professor Leepgott's course as a freshman two years ago. Since then, he had continued to enroll in Leepgott's more advanced courses and pick the man's brain about the strange entries on the internet. Charles was killing time every class period while the others, majoring in some nonsense that would likely make no difference in the world, actually struggled to get through Ancient Western History. He simply wanted to stay after and ask about the most recent pages uncovered from this alternate encyclopedia. \n\nHe erased a ragged edge down the flag and redrew it to be a torn and tattered flag. Then he placed 1769 above 2016 and 1771 above 2018, and began to draw the remnants of a space craft to one side of the moon. \n\nHis mind was busy with possibilities as he drew, thinking of what might have caused '*the almost*' to devolve the way it seemed to. \n\nA pleasant alarm sounded from Professor Leepgott's reading tablet, interrupting him mid-sentence. \n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, please remember your papers will be due by the end of the month!\" Leepgott did not so much raise his voice as strengthen his words as the students shuffled and crammed their belongings together, eager to leave for their next classes. \"I will happily help anyone whom stays after class with questions. My office hours are also posted on the class webpage.\"\n\nCharles quietly gathered his things together, carefully ensuring he did not do so too quickly. He wanted to ensure he was the last one in the classroom, and was not surprised to find that the last student closed a laptop and sprinted up the steps and out the door. \n\nProfessor Leepgott fiddled with his reading tablet for a moment before he looked up and met Charles's gaze.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Messier,\" Professor Leepgott smiled. \"I presume you don't have any questions about this assignment?\"\n\n\"I've already given you a packet on the history of Massilia, sir.\" Charles smiled as he walked down to the front of the classroom. \"I even threw in a few subtle tidbits I picked up during my other research.\"\n\n\"Yes, I caught those.\" Professor Leepgott pointed a stern finger at the young man, \"I don't think you'd be amused if, when you're a well renowned scientist, someone dug up you Massilia Paper and pointed out that you insinuated a Germanic peoples called it Marseille and referenced it as a focal point in that same peoples revolution.\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure I wouldn't.\" Charles sat down on the desk and picked up the Professor's tablet, quickly typing as he spoke. \"Have you read the newest pages that have been uncovered?\"\n\nLeepgott sighed. \"No, I've been very busy. Is it something important?\"\n\n\n\"In the grand scheme, I don't think we can say what is and is not important.\" Charles handed the tablet over, \"At least not until we look back with the clarity of hindsight and the perspective of victory or defeat.\"\n\n\"How novel...\" Professor Leepgott trailed off as he adjusted his glasses on his nose and read the tablet. He was quiet as he did so, occasionally sliding a finger across the screen to shift the page. \n\n\"Have you wondered why we can only ever see the equivalent date to ours?\"\n\n\"Hm?\" Professor Leepgott looked up at Charles.\n\n\"Have you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Yes, I have.\" Professor Leepgott read a bit more before he set the tablet down. \"Well, how very odd.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Charles was unabashedly excited whenever Professor Leepgott said something was odd.\n\n\"It is as though... their world has hit a tipping point.\" Leepgott removed his glasses and tapped them against his chin.\n\n\"The Rus and America coming so close to blows?\"\n\n\"Exactly. We've seen what happens when the Steppe sets itself against the rest of the world. All too well, in fact, do we know of the outcome.\"\n\n\"What do you think will happen?\"\n\n\"I think we will wait and read, my boy.\" Professor Leepgott smiled as he stood up and patted Charles on the shoulder. \"As I have done for many years, we will wait and read. I've papers to grade, otherwise I'd have a longer chat.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Charles was visibly disappointed. \"Didn't you have any other thoughts?\"\n\nProfessor Leepgott laughed as he packed his tablet and laptop into his satchel. \"Normally, yes, I would. But we're nearing Saturnalia, my boy, and my daughter will arrive soon. I've little time to get as much as I can accomplished so I can spend every minute possible with her.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Charles stood and grabbed his bag as Leepgott began to walk toward the stairs. He was quick to follow. \"I just thought you'd have an idea of what might happen, or what circumstances caused their politics to devolve so rapidly.\"\n\n\"It is the fate of man, Mr. Messier, to either overcome tribalism or be consumed by it.\" Professor Leepgott sneezed, made the warding symbol with his hands, and continued. \"Apologies. I can only assume we will receive ever more chaotic updates from '*the almost*' until it simply is no more.\"\n\nThey were silent as they continued their walk. Charles wanted to say so much more. What if there was a way to see more from '*the almost*'? What if they could find a way to communicate with it? The man had spent decades casually researching it, and now that it had updates which seemed to indicate it was falling into a strange almost end-times, his response was to casually disregard it in favor of his now?\n\nAs they reached Professor Leepgott's car, a small cat emerged and hissed at both of them before it sprinted into the hedges.\n\n\"I hate that thing.\" Leepgott pursed his lips as he watched the leaves rustle. \"It has been doing that for weeks.\"\n\nCharles did not respond.\n\n\"My boy,\" Leepgott sighed as he turned to face the young man. \"I love our chats, but this is just bad timing. In all my time reading about '*the almost*', I have understood it to be much the same as our timeline. As humans, we go through wars and peace with much the same grace as a crippled cat. It is as though we once knew how to handle them with care, but have long since forgotten.\"\n\n\"What if we could help them? We've been at peace for so long that we've almost made it to Mars. We are better than men of stone and steel, Professor.\" Charles stared at Leepgott as the man was silent.\n\nA few moments passed before he responded. \"I believe we are no better, my boy. Stone is ground away by the years, and steel rusts like all the rest. Our peace can only last so long. Recall that before the Imperator's Peace we had the Sundered Age. Centuries of war, my boy.

The scientists scurried around me, connecting wires and pressing buttons. Finally, a green light came on and they signaled to the viewing room. They stood up, my wife pressed her hand to the glass, crying. I could feel a tear stream down my own face. The president and others stood and saluted me before nodding to the scientist. He pulled the lever, and everything went black. I could feel my mind stretching, like the feeling of falling in a dream, but instead of a second it felt like hours.\n\nI went from ice to burning hot and back to ice, screaming the whole way through.

No. Henry's body may have survived the experiment, but he did died when you pulled that lever. I'm in charge of his body now.

The silence of the room was deafening, broken only by the electric hum and the beeping of the timer as it ticked closer and closer to the end. 00:45. Finally, a scientist spoke again,\n\n\"Are you evil?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"So you're good?\"\n\n\"No. There is no absolute good or evil. There is no relative good or evil.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\n\"The fact that you would ask that question just shows you aren't ready for the truth.\"\n\n\"Is time travel possible?\"\n\n\"Yes and no.\"\n\nThe scientists were in a mixture of frustration and despair. They looked at the president, who sat staring into a corner in the viewing room. His wife was the last one standing,\n\n\"Why won't you answer our questions?!

Kerry told me she wanted me to pick up green onions and Cheyenne from the store in my way home today. Jonjon needed a new bag of food, but that could wait a few days. I wanted a new toothbrush since I'd just gotten over that cold. She told me that my first paycheck would be looking very, very shiny in the mail.\n\nNobody would tell me what The Prisoner was convicted of. They told me what she looked like, even though I would see for myself from about nine to five every day. Black hair, fair skin, freckles, thin arms. Toothy grin, every now and again, and hospital blue scrubs for clothes. \n\nThey told me that there was no audio on my end. They told me that I could hear her, and she could never hear me. They didn't install a mute button, they said they needed to hear everything and anything. \n\nThey told me that she was never going to heal. That every effort had already been made and spurned, and that the situation was too dangerous, too delicate, for any kind of real psychological help.\n\nI guess that's why they thought having me watch her was a nice, neat compromise. Work in my field had been short as of late, but serving doctor-cum-jail guard didn't sound impossible. Grim work if nothing else. I couldn't imagine Kerry locked up in such a place. This Prisoner, the unnamed, surely must have been an insidious bitch. Still, I've always been of the opinion that people are people, and people are always rational unless they don't have the biological components for it. It's not only good morals, it's good science. \n\nThe parking gate attendant has a guest. It's a nice guy in a smart navy suit. He has a few things pinned to it. He waives me in, so I don't have to show my ID. He says he recognizes me from the interview.\n\nI know for a fact he wasn't in that room of twelve people. I've got a slick memory for that sort of thing.\n\nMy parking space is the last empty one, in the back, by the emergency exit door. By the time I get out of my car, Mr. Blue Suit is already there.\n\n\"You can use this door,\" he says, pointing to it. \"It won't actually sound the alarm.\"\n\nI'm skeptical of this man, but knowing how high security this place is, I figure he can't be some con. I move slowly towards the door in the hopes he takes the hint and opens it for me, but perhaps that's too subtle. I approach and give it a push.\n\nThere is a long hallway there are no doors except three at the very end, smushed as faraway as possible. The tiles are pristine and my new shoes nearly slip a bit on them. The black, fine mesh walls remind me of mosquito nets. I nearly run my hand against one when I think better of it and proceed. The man leads me to the first, and only, door to my right. He holds out his hand for my mobile, I pass it over. Man, are these the weirdest places. \n\n\"This is your office. Feel free to decorate. As I know you recall, someone will relieve you of your task, do not leave first. And no matter what, eyes on the target.\"\n\n\"Yessir. Who can I call if I need to step out...\" he gives me a death glare, \"to um, freshen up?\"\n\n\"There's an attached suite for that. We'll send you anything you need. There's a buzzer in the same room.\" I nod in understanding as he palms the doorknob. Five clicks and it opens, no key.\n\n\"Your replacement.\"\n\nSomeone stands. I lean in from the side of the doorframe to get a closer look before my attendant grabs me by the arm and lightly tugs/shoves me in with them.\n\n\"Thank you,\" whomever it is rasps. \"Thank you.\" They leave. There's some kind of trick of light that keeps their face in shadow, but not their suspiciously gaunt frame for a desk job. The door shuts behind me. \n\nThe new digs are pretty cool. Three walls are taken up by floor to ceiling monitor screens. A table lies in the center with a comfy, mesh chair. That must be my desk, even if it looks like a break room's furniture. There's a sky blue filter of light hanging over them from ceiling fluorescents. There are cameras in my room, go figure. They don't appear to be on, they could just be dummy cameras. The wall not taken up has, unsurprisingly, a little archway. A glance into that room reveals four closed caption TVs, a pneumatic tube like a bank ATM, and some toilet amenities, oddly including a shower. In the main chamber, the other side of the wall not in use has a large mirror, arranged in panes like a yoga studio. \n\n\"Hello,\" I hear from a tinny speaker. The crackling voice is high, sweet. I can almost hear... Kerry's adopted, younger sister through that sound.\n\nThe Prisoner on the monitor, I discover, is a child, aged ten to fourteen. Black hair, fair skin, freckles- toothy grin. She's missing one in the top row, far left. I step back, on impulse. \n\n\"You're new. I like new people.\"\n\nDoes she have a camera feed too? That wouldn't be right. How does she know?\n\n\"They're fun. They remember.\"\n\nI contemplate this for a moment. Now that I'm here, and I can see her, I can start to diagnose whatever it is she has. What could prompt giving her such deep isolation? \n\nObviously, since there's no responses I can give her, I take a seat in the chair before the wide desk. There's no computer, but I get a phone, paper and pens. I suppose I can draw to pass the time. \n\n\"I know you have a wife and a puppy. He's very cute.\"\n\nIt now strikes me that something is very, very wrong.\n\nShe's giggling. I'm locked on the portrait of her face, not only viewable al all angles, but audible at all sides. The atmosphere becomes quiet, contemplative. Her smile is permanent, I haven't seen it move except to open, even when she laughs. Her eyes close, she breathes through her nose. \n\n\"You went to the beach when you were three and got pinched by a black sand crab. That's your first memory.\"\n\nWhere is she getting this from?!? I stand at my desk, barely blinking, feeling the memory in my head-\n\n\"There was that birthday party when you were seven. Your airplane cake fell on the floor and you tried to eat all of the icing anyway. You got a little dump truck for that party.\"\n\nThere's quite the timeskip in her- my, reminiscences. Perhaps she isn't all seeing. I hope so.\n\n\"There was that class you took in high school. You had no friends. Everyone hated you. You're still insecure.\" Vitriol follows her next admission. She's traveling down the darker road of my life. I got into drugs, was dealing with-\n\n\"Stop that,\" she says. \"I'm reading, not you.\"\n\nI didn't say anything. Nobody had entered her room.\n\n\"I remember everything,\" she promises me. \"I can.\"\n\n\"I know about the time you pirated a copy of X-Men. You do that an awful lot.\"\n\nI cringe, thinking about the building we're in, what else she can confess-\n\nI run to the bathroom for the pneumatic tube and buzzer. \n\n\"Go away, mister,\" the TV crackles. \"If you leave I get someone new. I like new people.\"\n\nI stop, hand hovering over the button. Should I ask for help..? If she kept talking would... they believe her? \n\nDid I believe her? She was a prisoner. Theoretically, it could all be lucky guesses. Really, really lucky ones. Maybe that's why she's here, she got caught playing the odds and getting way too lucky. \n\nDoes she actually like new people, or is it reverse psychology? \n\n\"You're borderline alcoholic. Your daddy cheated on your mommy twice and you never noticed.\"\n\nWhat the hell?\n\n\"That's why it's good he's going to die soon. He's getting cancer on his left knee. Too many days...\" she trails off.\n\nI feel nauseous. It's like having my own arms twisted behind my back while someone strips away my skin. This kid... this Prisoner... what happened to her?\n\n\"I'm special,\" she says, before stopping. It takes her visible effort to finish. \"And you're not. You're one of nine billion.\"\n\nI'm starting to tune it out. She's delusional, but just... just getting one or two bits right, getting lucky. I bet my dad doesn't have cancer. And him cheating? That's a ridiculously primitive accusation. \n\n\"Kerry's pregnant,\" the Prisoner promises. \"It's going to die of a bloody miscarriage, yay.\"\n\nI'm glad I'm in the bathroom. I vomit. I smash the buzzer button, holding it, praying I can leave before she says something else.\n\n\"You don't leave until you're replaced,\" she promises. \"We're going to have lots. Of. Fun.\"\n\n---~\n\nIn another room, a man in a navy suit sips coffee. He's watching a trained professional cry onto the linoleum tile.\n\n\"The Video Isolation Program Effort R.6 is a success,\" he says into his palm recorder. \"Subject can be led to believe in the power of fictitious psychic abilities.\"\n\nHe thumbs through the short script file accumulated on this man, just an average citizen. \n\nHe flicks his tongue in interest: his real, forked one.

You see friends, family, and people you never really knew die in front of you. At first it shocks you and frightens you, like anything strange in life. But after about fifty years of people randomly dying from doing good deeds in front of you, well, you just get used to it. \n\n     People here don\u2019t die like normal though, they don\u2019t die like how you die. In fact, aging in general is just useless, so we stopped that a while ago. Not saying we don\u2019t age, we\u2019re born as babies just like you, but we only grow older until about the age of twenty three. After that our looks sort of just stop. No wrinkles, or grey hair, no bags under our eyes, or crows feet setting in above our cheeks. \n\n     The way we die, the big goal, is to go to heaven, or to have so much fun that heaven doesn\u2019t want you. Going to hell is the easy part, this can take months, if not weeks.      \n\n      Going to heaven is the hard part. That\u2019s when you have to actually do good deeds, feed the hungry, give money towards good causes, all the boring stuff in the world. The earliest this usually takes is 25 years. \n\n       Myself, why would I want to be anywhere else when I can be in the same place I\u2019ve grown up in. The same home I was born in, lost my virginity in, had all my memories in. \n\n      As a teenager I got a job at a store. After my manager went to hell for cheating on his wife (for the 56th time) the job was given to me. Since then I\u2019ve just lived a normal life. Don\u2019t do anything crazy, just live. Go to work, go home, watch tv, eat, sleep. That\u2019s it. \n\n      The difficult thing is that even the smallest of good deeds goes towards your heaven. I helped a lady out to her car the other day, then stole three dollars from her purse. I figured it evened out enough. \n\n      The biggest question you\u2019re probably wondering is, this life seems so boring. Do no good, do no bad, what\u2019s the point of living. Well to be honest I\u2019m afraid of the other side. Hell is, well, it\u2019s hell. Heaven, how great can it really be? Everyone has their own interpretation of what it is, singing, dancing, drinking, but how do we know what it really is? I just don\u2019t trust it. \n\n     If you live 100 years, you\u2019ll feel the same way. So just wait until you reach 200. \n\n     The other day, I broke my own rule. I didn\u2019t go home. I went to a bar. \n\n     I walked in the bar to the smell of piss and shame. Literal piss, a man with a bald head, and big arms stood in the corner, holding both arms towards his crotch, as the sound of a running hose ran down towards the carpet. \n\n     This is what you find in the hell spots. \n\n     I walked towards the bar and sat on a red leather covered stool. A beautiful woman walked over, long curly blonde hair, nice lips, nice eyes, big breasts, and probably only late 50\u2019s (you can start to tell a difference after a while). \n\n     \u201cWhat\u2019ll you have?\u201d She asked, she placed her palms on the bar and bent down at the waist. \n\n      \u201cWhatever\u2019s cheapest is fine.\u201d \n\n      \u201cWe don\u2019t give water.\u201d \n\n      \u201cI mean the cheapest beer, I don\u2019t give a shit, I\u2019m just here to watch the game.\u201d My tv had recently broke, and the big game was on. \n\n      Men speckled throughout the bar, a couple to a table here and there. A couple lonely drinkers. A place to come forget their sorrows, forget that they\u2019ll probably be in hell soon. \n\n      She handed me a tall frothy glass of beer and walked away. I pulled it close and spun my finger around the top as I watched the sports player hit a home run. I sunk my head and took a big drink of the beer. \n \n    \u201cWhat the fuck!?\u201d I turned around to see one of the men wrapping his hands around the waitresses ass cheek. She grabbed his glass and flung it towards his bald head, gold liquid splashing over his reflective head. \n\n     Another man came up behind him wrapping his arm around the guy\u2019s neck and throwing him to the ground. Tumbling in circles throwing punches at the ribs. \n\n     Every man was soon in the fight, along with the waitresses throwing glasses and the bartender pulling out a shot gun firing openly at each person. Not able to kill, but able to slow them down. \n\n     I sunk down and went on all fours, I started crawling slowly towards the door. A hand tugged on the back of my collar pulling me up and getting me in a head lock. The man spun me around and had a fist full of my shirt while cocking his arm back. \n\n     His arm slowly lowered before bringing it to my hair, he grabbed a hair and plucked it. The whole bar began to silence and stop in a matter of seconds. \n\n     The bartenders barrel starting to lower as she realized what was going on. \n\n     He held in between his thumb and index a silver strand of hair. His mouth agape showing a few front teeth missing with blood dripping out. \n\n    Men in headlocks, and in compromising positions all facing towards me. \n\n    \u201cHow old are you?\u201d He asked in the silence. It was illegal to be more than 200 years old. Anyone over 200 years old is stripped of any money and titles they have, thrown on the streets with clothes that become rags, and empty stomachs. Their reasoning being that if you\u2019re in a bad situation long enough you\u2019ll do something crazy to get out, the hellish kind of crazy. \n\n    \u201cI\u2019m 124,\u201d I said randomly. It was the first number that came to mind. \n\n    His face slowly zoomed in on mine, looking near my eyes to see faint lines creasing in. Lightly discolored circles starting to fill in underneath my eyes. \n\n    \u201cCall 9-1-1.\u201d He said to the bartender. He pulled my head under his arm and fell to the floor. I floundered through his arm, trying to make space as the beautiful woman picked up the line and was murmuring to the police. \n\n     One swing came in, landing right below my eye. Stars followed with the sense of hollowness in my head. I blinked through it to open my eyes to his knuckles coming towards me again, landing on my forehead. \n\n    That\u2019s about the last punch I remember before fainting.\u201d I\u2019m wearing tattered clothes, ripped and torn. I have a long beard, grey hairs now peppered in, along with long hair sitting under a beanie. \n\n    A man is tied to a chair in front of me, grey duct tape placed over his mouth. He\u2019s crying and pleading with his eyes. He may not be able to die, but he can feel pain. \n\n    \u201cSo I\u2019m really sorry for this. I hope you can now see why I\u2019m doing this.

Why was I still sitting there?\n\nI jumped up and started slowly backing away.\n\n\"DONE!\" he smirked and held the paper aloft for me to see. At that moment I accidentally stumbled over a loose brick on the sidewalk. I fell hard. My head hit something with a crunch and the whole world became a gong I couldn't hear... but man could I feel it!\n\nHe stood over me smirking. He lowered a gloved finger into my pooling blood and wiped the result on my face.\n\n\"You thought you had it all figured didn't you. Your every move throughout the city was scripted the past hour. Your drawing had been a complex program for your brain to follow. You knew you would find me after the third Rite Aide. You knew your calculated visions of the future were too complex for a mere mortal's memories so you encoded them as the image.\"\n\nI was trembling though it was probably due to the shock.\n\n\"But you didn't realize I had been observing you as Elastic Man from the balcony above,\" He smiled, \"I committed your image to memory and then in this hour I deciphered it's complex meaning. I then simply countered your scripted dance with my own and Cha Cha'ed your brains onto the broken sidewalk!\" \n\nThen he cackled the most evil cackle I had ever heard. That was when I suddenly knew the moment was right. The clock struck 3am and I became Shark Man just as I had predicted an hour before.\n\nThe smell of my own blood engorged my body with endorphins and I devoured him then and there. \n\n\"How? How did you defeat me!\" He screamed his last words before I snapped his chin loose from his skull. \n\nI left his ears for the last bite as I whispered, \"I stored the last part of my plan as words in my own head. I narrated the last part in my head so you couldn't see. I must have known you were there the whole time.\"\n\nThen one last satisfying chomp ended the 10 year struggle. \n\n\n---\n\nEdit: Fixed bad grandma rrr.", "author": "VaterWater"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7hh2ia/wp_for_decades_theres_been_a_huge_clock_hovering/dqr24f8/", "score": 106, "prompt": " For decades there's been a huge clock hovering over Earth, counting down.

When business was booming, he had more than a hundred employees under him, and every trade publication carried glowing reviews of the ethics the agency exemplified. New work flowed in like water from melting ice caps. The agency was so busy that at one point, Leonard\u2019s time was exclusively reserved for the richest and most powerful of their clientele. \n\n*How times have changed*, thought Leonard, as he studied the elderly couple seated before him. They were not famous, and there was no newsworthy angle to their request. They were, however, the agency\u2019s first potential clients in months.\n\n\u201cMr and Mrs Reyland,\u201d Leonard said, \u201cwhat you are asking for is highly unusual. I\u2019m afraid I must insist to understand your motivations before I can proceed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not what we were told,\u201d said Mark Reyland. He stabbed a finger at the bundled papers on Leonard\u2019s desk. \u201cThe forms were filled out perfectly, and the permit\u2019s been granted. There is no need for us to justify ourselves to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on, hold on. I\u2019m not here to judge you,\u201d said Leonard. \u201cBut I do have my agency\u2019s reputation to consider. It is only fair that I know what I am getting us into. And if you don\u2019t like the way we do things, you can always go to our competitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll pay your fees! Just do the job!\u201d said Emily Reyland. \u201cSure looks like your agency needs the work! Why are you asking so many questions?\u201d\n\nLeonard didn\u2019t like to admit it, but despite the hesitation he was feeling about this case, his mind had already charted out multiple options for the task at hand. It was force of habit, from the years he had spent honing his craft. When the new laws went into effect, giving everyone the opportunity to legally Terminate one other person each, Leonard\u2019s agency thrived on taking the mess out of the equation.\n\nAfter all, if people were willing to pay a plumber to fix their pipes, or an electrician to tweak their circuitboards, why not pay people like Leonard to Terminate their targets? It was all about providing a service, and it was there that Leonard and his agency excelled. To Leonard, it was just a job like any other, and he did not worry too much about the morality of what he was doing \u2013 that was for the politicians to debate, and as long as the permits were granted by the government, Leonard would do as his clients asked.\n\nIt now appeared that there were lines which even Leonard was not prepared to cross. He grit his teeth, held tightly on the smile he reserved for his most trying clients, and asked, \u201cJust indulge me, please. What could possibly have gone so wrong that you want me to Terminate your eight year-old granddaughter? What do her parents have to say about this?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer parents are dead,\u201d said Mark, as Emily averted her eyes and focused on the world outside the windows. \u201cNothing to do with us. Car accident, down the highway. They couldn\u2019t be saved.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d said Leonard. \u201cAnd I assume your granddaughter passed into your care?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did,\u201d said Mark. \u201cBeen with us every day since.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will make things clearer,\u201d said Mark, as he retrieved a photograph and slid it across the table. \u201cShe was hurt in the crash too. Doctors say she\u2019s stable now, but all she does now is sit in her room, all quiet-like. She doesn\u2019t talk, she doesn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s hard even just to get her to eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then you\u2019ve got to bring her to a therapist,\u201d said Leonard. \u201cSomeone who can help her get-\u201d\n\nEmily piped up then, her voice cutting Leonard off. \u201cWe\u2019ve not got long ourselves, Mr Mullen. I\u2019ve got cancer, and Mark\u2019s heart is not what it used to be. We\u2019re not leaving Chloe here by herself. We\u2019re the only family she\u2019s got. She\u2019s coming with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat my wife means to say is, we\u2019re not asking you to Terminate her now. But once we\u2019re gone, you\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why!\u201d asked Leonard. \u201cShe\u2019s alive! She\u2019s healthy! Why\u2019s she got to go when you two do?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe ain\u2019t got family, Mr Mullen,\u201d said Emily. \u201cWe know what happens to young girls who\u2026 who are cared for by the state, passed around from foster home to foster home. She ain\u2019t healthy too. She\u2019s\u2026 hurt, inside, and we don\u2019t think she will get better.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Mr Mullen,\u201d said Mark. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to help us. The thought\u2026 the thought that when we go, that Chloe\u2019s all alone here, with no one to care for her\u2026 I don\u2019t want to have to do this, but goddammit, if you\u2019re not going to help us, then I will have to\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, wait,\u201d said Leonard. \u201cJust wait a damn second.\u201d Leonard rooted around in his jacket for his jacket, then retrieved a photograph from within. It was his turn to slide it over to his clients. \u201cThat\u2019s my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been blessed with children. What if\u2026 what if we took Chloe in instead, after the two of you can\u2019t care for her anymore?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo offence, Mr Mullen,\u201d Mark said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know you. You\u2019re not better than any of the foster families the state would give us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difference is, I can offer to take Chloe in now, and you can stick around to see that we\u2019re meeting your expectations. A trial period, if you will. Heck, Chloe herself may not like us, and if she doesn\u2019t then the deal\u2019s off too. And I\u2019d have to ask my wife first, of course, but if she agrees\u2026 will you at least consider it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could simply change your mind after we\u2019re gone!\u201d said Emily. \u201cYou\u2019ll be as bad as everyone else!\u201d\n\n\u201cI could have accepted your job at the start,\u201d said Leonard. \u201cI could have simply taken your permit, your fees, and made the necessary plans. An eight-year-old girl is about the easiest target which has cross my path in years. But I refused until I learned more, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 why would you do something like this? You\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re a killer, Mr Mullen.\u201d\n\nLeonard smiled. \n\n\u201cYou can be the judge of that yourself, whether you want to leave Chloe with us,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cShall I call my wife now?\u201d\n\n--- \n\n/r/rarelyfunny\n", "author": "rarelyfunny"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7iehk6/wp_every_human_on_earth_is_given_one_card_from_a/dqy5t8y/", "score": 104, "prompt": " Every human on earth is given one card from a deck of cards when they are born which will determine their life.

It simply could not have come from here. These marks, too, they're consistent with atmospheric exit. Look how they flare out at the bottom. This is something from,\" Willis paused, \"From I don't know where.\"\n\nWillis removed his hand from the object, the plastic of his hazmat suit screeching against itself. This was a startling discovery. Tangible evidence, perhaps, of the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. International news coverage of the Pisces mission had been halted abruptly since the discovery of this object. False stories were created and fed to journalists: the mission had returned prematurely due to crew illness, some stated; there had been a fault with the main engine and the slingshot attempt had been aborted ran others. Nobody knew that now, in one small laboratory hidden beneath the streets of London, a small team of scientists were digesting the most disturbing discovery in human history.\n\nThe satellite was small. Small, that is, by our standards and understanding. An unassuming grey cube, bordered by four triangular sails. On one face, surrounded by these golden wings, lay a small indentation; at its core, a small golden disc, no bigger than one of the Pisces craft's data stores.\n\n\"Do we know how to access this,\" Moira asked, \"Perhaps we could extract the raw data and send it across to Analytics?\"\n\n\"It's worth a shot. Just take the whole disc to them. It's more use to them than us,\" Willis handed the disc to Moira, \"Strange though. Same configuration as Voyager.\"\n\nWillis continued to examine the lifeless satellite as Moira left the room. The Pisces crew had been in orbit of Mars at the time they intercepted the thing. Something had been jamming the signals from the PYTH4GORAS probe, presumably a jammed aerial or minor damage from debris kicked up by an asteroid impact was the general diagnosis. As Pisces approached PYTH4GORAS however, it became obvious that's something far more peculiar was to blame for the interruption. Its aerial had become entangled with the golden foils of this strange, alien satellite, and both probes were tangled and spinning out of control. A brief check by the Pisces crew confirmed no record of this second entangled craft, and so the mission priority was changed to retrieval and quarantine of this undocumented probe. Initial analysis by ground crews theorised that this had been an undisclosed launch by North Korea perhaps, disguised as one of their all too frequent ICBM tests.\n\nMoira returned to the laboratory.\n\n\"Willis-- Analytics have examined the disc. Are you sure that there's no documentation of this satellite anywhere? At all?\"\n\n\"Absolutely none. Like I said, the construction, the materials, the markings. Absolutely none. I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\n\"And there's no chances you've overlooked something?\"\n\n\"Absolutely none.\"\n\nMoira bit over her lip. \"This can't be possible, Willis. Analytics extracted the data from the disc. No encryption, no coding, nothing. Just a straight rip of the data and they say it's identical to the disc we sent with Voyager.\"\n\n\"Then it was left there, for us to discover. It can't be anything else. Someone has found Voyager out there, and they're letting us know. They must have known that we'd come searching for the broken probe.\"\n\n\"Then what does this mean?\"\n\n\"When will the Pisces be ready to launch again? We need to reply.

She picked up her phone and tapped the clock icon. The tab for 5:00 am was swiped off. \"Of course.\" She had gone to bed late Thursday after a eventful night, apparently she forgot to turn her alarm on, which was completely out of character. Then again, a lot things Alyssa was doing lately were out of character. \n\nShe jumped out of bed and grabbed her \"third Thursday of the month outfit\", throwing it on and rushing to the bathroom. She grabbed her tooth brush and started scrubbing her teeth, left, right, up, down, circle, circle, circle. She reached her back molar and heard a loud \"CRACK\".\nSpitting into the sink, Alyssa examined the bloody mess of foamy toothpaste and saliva, along with a healthy, white tooth. Her eyes widened and she peered into the mirror, opening her mouth as wide as she could to see which tooth fell out. She tongued the hole where her back tooth used to be and more blood came pouring out. She panicked.\n\n\"No. No, no, no, no, no.\", she cried as she wiped her face with a towel. She stared at herself in the mirror, thoughts swirling around what was happening. Just then, a zit popped up on the side of her face, bright pink and oily. Alyssa has never had a pimple before, let alone lost an adult tooth. She was a good person, kind and compassionate, generous, which made her beautiful and healthy. \n\nShe glanced at the time, 6:45. She knew was going to be late, there was no avoiding it, but she was not going to work with a zit. She rushed out of her apartment, starting her car and peeling out if the driveway. She drove to the closest grocery store, rushing to the cosmetics aisle. Alyssa eyed the foundation section with no clue as to what she was looking for. She had never had to buy make up before, she never had the need. Making sure no one was around, she grabbed the closest shade and rushed to pay for it. The clerk stared curiously at her, which Alyssa didn't blame her for. She was, after all, decked out a head scarf and big, round sunglasses. It was summer, and the sun had barely risen yet. She paid for her items and ran to her car, opening the cover up and blotching a quarter of the bottle onto her face.\n\"This can't be happening, I'm a good person. It was one mistake, just one!\" She cried tearlessly to herself, not wanting to smear the fresh junk she had just smeared all over her face. \nAlyssa raced to work, pulling into the employee of the month parking spot; her parking spot for the majority of the last year and a half. She took another look at herself in the rear-view and added a touch up on the zit, checking to see if any others had popped up. She sighed in relief as she found none and jumped out of the car. She found her desk and sat down, and even though she was still 15 minutes late, she was the only one here. She was always early, making sure everything was set up for a smooth and productive work day for everybody. \n\nFolding her hands on her desk, she sighed. She didn't want to believe that last night had happened. She thought about the dark road, the blood on her windshield and hair in her front grill and shook her head. No. Don't dwell on it. Think of happy things. Something on her hand caught her eye and she looked more closely. Her eyes widened as wrinkles appeared out of nowhere, covering each of her hands. Her nails started to chip and flake, turning a jaundice-yellow, and Alyssa's body started to shake in fear.\n\nHer friend Emily walked in and sat at her desk across from Alyssa's and started chatting like any other normal day.\n\n\"You wouldn't believe the traffic by my house, it was truly awful,\" she said as she unloaded her briefcase, not looking at Alyssa. \"I sat in the same spot for fifteen minutes!\"\n\nAlyssa sat there speechless, not knowing what to do or say. Emily looked up at her.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" She squinted her eyes at Emily's face, trying to get a better look. \"Uh, you know you have like... Zits on your face, right?...\" She looked closer. \"Is that a cold sore?!?\" \n\nAlyssa pulled out her compact mirror and inspected her face, running her hands through her hair. A big clump stuck between her fingers and fell into the desk in front of her. Emily gasped.\n\n\"What.... What did you do?!\" Alyssa buried her face into her grotesque hands and began to cry. Emily rushed to Alyssa's side and kneeled next to her. \"Sweetie, what did you do? Tell me, so I can help you fix it.\"\n\nAlyssa just shook her head, sobbing  uncontrollably. She heard an unfamiliar voice call her name and looked up. A handsome man in a suit stood there, with two cops behind him. \n\n\"Alyssa Weaver?,\" he asked. She nodded weakly. He motioned her to come closer. \"You're under arrest for the hit and run death of James Landon. You're being charged with manslaughter.\" Emily backed away from Alyssa's, her eyes wide and mouth open. The detective closed in and handcuffed her, walking her out of the building. He stuffed hey in the back of the car, explaining what was going to happen with her case. \"Honestly, since you have a spotless record, you're probably looking at five years, with some parole. Just keep your head up and try to stay out of trouble.\"\n\nEvery moment that passed, she felt sorrier for herself, and she could feel her face sagging, her stomach getting bloated, even her nose began to crook to the side. By the time she got to the jail, she looked like a different women; a hideous, witch-like version of her old self. All she could think about was her old face, her old body, her perfect job and life. And how it was all ruined.\n\n Then she realized that she should be feeling sorry for the man she hit, his family and friends. She didn't just take a life, she destroyed an entire families life. They deserved Justice, and she deserved to be here. But five years wasn't Justice. They lead her to a cell and closed the door. She knew what she had to do. She waited for the officers to leave the hall and grabbed the thin sheet from the cot tying it around the bars, and then wrapped the length of it around her neck. She put all of her weight into it, her lungs begging her for oxygen. Blackness began to take over, creeping into the edges of her sight. She welcomed it, she knew she deserved it. It wouldn't bring the man back, but it might bring some peace to the victims family. Finally, everything was black. Alyssa's fingers twitched as her heart beat for the last time, and a feeling of relief was the last thing she felt.\n\n Her spirit rose above her body, and she floated above it for a moment. Her hair began to grow back, going back to it's healthy shine. Her once-yellow nails were transitioning into her perfect manicured hands again, and her skin transformed, making her face flawless and clear, even more so then it was before.

Nobody really knew how much was there. We'd started weighing it, but even that was tedious. I was starting to get paranoid having that much money lying around.\n\nIt was literally everywhere. We'd filled all the cupboards. All the closets. There were garbage bags of rolled-up fives, tens, twenties. I was glad to be north of the border. I wondered if American drug dealers had to deal with a bunch of ones. Some of our guys on the street got paid in change, but they knew better than to bring it to us. No way we were gonna have rolls of loonies lying around. \n\nIt had gotten to a point where even my gacked-out \"business partners\" could see it was getting to be a problem. Our stash house was starting to feel more cramped by the day. It would be better if the rest of the space wasn't taken up with empty beer cans, over-full ash trays and disassembled electronic parts, but there was nothing I could hope to do about that part. I was glad I didn't spend much time there.\n\nI wasn't much in to meth. It's a love it or hate it thing. I was never much for uppers, I preferred dissos. Different strokes. PCP never sold like meth, though. Nothing sold like meth.\n\nI'd brought up the topic of a front more times than I could count. They didn't really get why we had to have one. They went by \"Six\" and \"Twitch\". They weren't exactly brilliant. They knew enough about meth and how to move it. Anything aside from that was far beyond their sphere of attention. \n\nSix was so named because he'd drink a six pack every day before breakfast. Twitch... well, I shouldn't have to tell you why people call him that.\n\nTwitch had thought laundering money meant literally putting it through the washing machine. Like I said, not the brightest.\n\nI'd had (in my mind) a brilliant idea. A used book store. Perfect front. Who's going to be keeping track of inventory? I could sell \"rare books\" for absurd prices. As long as I paid my taxes, nobody would give a shit. As long as you paid the CRA off, why would they look any harder? I mean, hell, Al Capone only got busted 'cause he didn't pay his taxes. \n\nGotta pay The Man his due.\n\nAnyway, I liked books. I liked reading. It was a lot better then having to listen to two meth heads on gack rants trying to reassemble a DVD player, anyway. They could deal with the dirty work. I hated dealing with sketched-out meth dealers, anyway. They were always paranoid, and it made me paranoid, too. Wigged-out meth heads with guns are exactly as fun as they sound. It's mostly safe, though, with reasonable precautions.\n\nIt inspires a bizarre sort of loyalty. As long as you have access to more, you're safe. They want what you got. Most of them are smart enough to at least realize you don't fuck with your supply chain. Really the only thing to worry about is cops and other distributors. The latter more than the former, by far.\n\nI didn't care any more. I was going to spend all day sitting in my book store, reading and drinking god damned espresso and making that money squeaky-clean. \n\nI'd collected a shitload of random books. Some I got for cheap off the internet with prepaid credit cards; others I'd bought at thrift stores; some I stole from various book sharing spots around the city. It's not like any of them would really sell, anyway, they were mostly for show. Lots of them weren't even in English.\n\nI got a couple tweakers to pack all the books for me and lug them to the store. I paid them in crystal; the whole process cost me about $11. The trick was to give them just enough to want more, then hold out on them. They'll do literally anything for just a bit more.\n\nNot to give you the wrong idea. I mean, I've obviously got a pretty crooked moral compass, but I'm not *evil*. I just sometimes take advantage of a situation. I know some guys who stage bum fights, winner takes a gram of whatever they want. Loser typically ends up in the hospital, or worse. Winner generally ends up in one of those places not long after, too. Some people just shouldn't be allowed to have a big bag of drugs.\n\nI'm one of those people, but at least I know it. \n\nTo be honest, I needed the book store more than I knew.\n\nAn incredible peaces settled over the little store when they left. I had the place all to myself. It was just some dingy, hole-in-the-wall with bare walls and shelves of books placed randomly with no rhyme or reason. I didn't care. \n\nI had a mini fridge, and espresso machine, a library of books I'd never read and a rainbow of different weed strains to smoke.\n\n\"Fuck those tweakers,\" I thought to myself.\n\nI rolled up a fat joint and fixed a latte, picked a book at random and sat behind the sad, peeling melamine counter. It looked like something out of an old hospital. Relentlessly, disgustingly beige. It clashed violently with the exposed brickwork and plumbing which lent it an otherwise pleasantly rustic atmosphere.\n\nI'd dropped big bucks on the chair, though. I figured if I was going to be sitting here all day, I might as well be comfortable. Settling back, I sparked my doobie, took a sip of latte and cracked my book.\n\n*Ding-a-ling-ding* rang the chime dangling at the front door. \n\n**Fuck.**\n\nI'd forgotten to lock the door. The store reeked of weed. I hastily stubbed the joint out and tried to stifle my coughing. God damn it.\n\nI sat up straight and looked down the long, narrow room to the front. I could just see the silhouette of a figure outlined by the sun coming through the door. \n\n\"Uh, hi,\" I choked out between coughs. \"How can I help?\"\n\n\"Oh, I just wandered in to see what the new book store is all about!\" came the voice of what was very clearly an elderly woman. \"Goodness, I hope I didn't surprise you! Did something go down the wrong tube?\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked, a little confused.\n\nShe moved closer and I hastily stuffed the ash tray out of sight.\n\n\"Did you choke on something, dearie?\" she asked.\n\n*She probably has no clue what pot smells like. Roll with it.*\n\n\"Ah... uh, yeah. Yeah, I, uh... inhaled some, uh... my coffee.\"\n\nWhy was this happening? I had to get her out of here.\n\n*Ding-a-ling-ding* went the front door again.\n\nFuck. How did people even know this place existed? I'd purposely picked a spot in the ass-end of town so people would stay away. \n\n\"Heeeeeeyyyy man. Smells good in here.\" Judging by the look of the guy talking, the same couldn't be said for him. His hair appeared to be one enormous dreadlock, with a very distressed-looking toque stretched over his head. His silhouette looked like some bizarre alien creature.\n\nGod damn it.\n\n(Wrapping this up here, I'm going to bed.

No good ever came of mentioning him at all.\n\nWhen I told my older brother that the penguin was the one biting the corners off of his books, he told on my parents at once even though I hate the taste of paper. Another time, when I was four, I saw the penguin about to bite through my mother's neck, and I shoved her out of the way just in time. I was grounded for a year for my efforts. Mrs. Jacobski didn't believe me, either, in the first grade, when I told her the penguin was the one that kept eating all the toys and the pencils. A week after that I had to start taking the awful pills. Five different kids punched me in the fourth grade after I mentioned him; the penguin would have killed them otherwise. \n\nAfter that I became convinced the penguin was the devil, or at least one of his highest lackeys. It made sense to me - only I could see him, and he seemed only to exist to create trouble around me. Perhaps exclusively to get *me* in trouble. He's been doing it less ever since I got wise to his ways. These last ten years all he's ever done was stare at me, stalking me every waking hour of my life. He even visited my dreams, every night, for both the good dreams and the nightmares he creates.\n\nBut that's all he's ever done. I've ignored him every time he's put a fellow human being in peril, and he began hesitating before he could follow through with his heinous deeds. And ever since he has not found a way to bring chaos and mayhem to me or anyone else. \n\nUntil now.\n\nNow, when this strange woman, a blind date set up from out of nowhere, has asked me about him. That was something no one else could do.\n\nI looked at the penguin. The six-foot behemoth merely shrugged, a mischievous look in his beady eyes. This had to be a trick of his, but he would not fool me.\n\nSo I shrugged and asked, \"What penguin?\"\n\nThe woman laughed, and pointed right at him. \"The six-foot tall penguin standing over your right shoulder.\"\n\nI snickered, though she was right about his location. \"Funny.\"\n\n\"I'm being serious.\"\n\nI sighed, spearing a meatball from the bowl in front of me. *Who is this woman?* I thought to myself. \"Alright, look,\" I said. \"All my life I've been seeing this six-foot tall penguin, yes, but he's not there. It's a hallucination. As to why, perhaps it's because I had some delusions that he was creating trouble for me, and I got those delusions to pass off my misfortunes on a phantasm that doesn't exist because I never wanted to hurt anyone else. Happy?\"\n\nI thought for sure that parroting back the same malarkey the shrinks fed me would convince her, but the woman shook her head, completely serious. \"I'm afraid not. He's right there.\"\n\n\"He isn't real.\"\n\n\"He is to you.\"\n\n\"No one else can see him.\"\n\n\"I can,\" said the woman, \"through your mind's eye.\"\n\nI stared at her blankly. The penguin cackled from behind. \"Um...\"\n\n\"Must I spell it out for you? I can read minds.\"\n\n\"Right. And my feathered friend just got engaged.\"\n\n\"You grew up with one older brother and two younger siblings, a boy and a girl. Your father was killed in a hit and run accident when you were eleven. You've been employed exactly six times, four times in restaurants. You hate the taste of paper. You're allergic to dogs, pollen and cinnamon. Now ask me how I know all this.\"\n\nI didn't even flinch. I simply stared disinterestedly at my food, twirling some more pasta with my fork. \"Easy,\" I said. \"You asked my mother about all this. Or you talked to one of my siblings.\"\n\nThe woman chuckled. \"Except that your mother's out of town on business, your older brother is overseas in Japan on deployment, your younger brother is beginning his first job way over in Colorado, and your sister is finishing up college in Virginia. She's majoring in political science, minor in media production.\"\n\n\"It's still more plausible than anything else you could come up with,\" I said with a snarl. I tried to keep it out of my voice - the fact that I couldn't only made the penguin cackle some more.\n\nThe woman frowned; she *seemed* concerned, but it only seemed that way. \"Look,\" she said, \"I know what you've been through thanks to this...fiend, behind you. You're always getting blamed for his misdeeds. But now you don't have to face any of this alone. I can help you.\"\n\n\"I highly doubt that. If anything, you're in league with my 'friend' behind me, and you're not fooling me. Either of you.\"\n\n\"And how do you think that is?\"\n\nI popped another meatball into my mouth. \"You haven't touched your food at all yet. Not even a breadstick.

Stepping inside the atmosphere was warm and welcoming unlike the bitter freeze outside. A quick glance around and I could tell exactly what kind of bar this was. An old bartender was polishing his glasses behind a run down counter, paying no mind to his new walk in. A pissed drunk man slumped over half asleep in the far corner booth, and a smell of cigarettes and liquor that would stick to your clothes for weeks. This was a place mostly for regulars, who came to drown their sorrows and forget the past. All I needed was a quick respite from the icy temperatures.\n\nI walked up to the counter and took a seat on one of the stools. As I sat one leg gave way by half an inch and sent my life flashing before my eyes before I quickly regained balance. Getting up and moving to a new seat I addressed the barkeep. \"Can I get a glass of water?\"\n\n\"Just a glass of water?\" he said lifting an eyebrow.\n\n\"Yeah, just water. Oh and uh...no ice please. I got enough of that stuff outside, heh.\" It was clear my sense of humor was lacking, as the bartender didn't even crack a pity smile.\n\n\"Glass of water, no ice. Right.\" The barkeep stopped polishing his glass, stepped out from behind the counter and motioned towards me. \"If you would follow me sir.\"\n\nI was hesitant at first, what kind of bar takes customers to a separate room for a glass of water? As I followed his lead through a narrow and cramped storage room, the old man flipped a circuit breaker and the far wall slid away revealing a lavish den. A red velvet chair sat next to a dark mahogany end table with a tray of every type of liquor imaginable, all dimly lit by the faint glow of a nearby fireplace.\n\n\"If you would kindly wait here Mr. Bond.\" The man bowed, extending an arm towards the chair.\n\n\"Uh...don't mind if I do.\" I said hastily making my way into the chair, my body melting into the velvet like butter. I didn't know who this Bond guy was and thankfully neither did the barkeep, but It was clear Mr. Bond lives in style.\n\nA few hours passed and I was already getting a bit tipsy when the barkeep walked back in the room. \"Sir the helicopter has arrived to escort you.\"\n\nMy face immediately lit up. First private rooms, then fine liquor, and now helicopter rides? Mr. Bond you dog!

Old farm hand jumps out the car instantly and before anybody had an idea of what was going on he'd dragged this poor young man from the driving seat and proceeded to smash his face into the tarmac as if he were violently deflating a football.

I was speechless, as I was being restrained another officer came and stood next to us, all 3 of us watched this farmhand mash that young mans skull into mince meat, after he was done he wiped his hands on his t-shirt, straightened out his pants while profusely panting then got in his car and drove away. I stayed on the highway for about an hour after that, I couldn't get the noise his skull made on every beat to the tarmac, took me a few months to get my head round it but after a few more instances of watching people get murdered you kind of get used to it.

He engraved all of his rifles with an \u2018S\u2019 on the side.\u201d\n\nThe old man stopped shuffling. He squirmed a little bit and dropped some papers. He turned around to face us.

Most of mine don\u2019t go above eruption grade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe code word is Phantom,\u201d Jules said. The store settled for a moment and went quiet. I felt a small hostile presence but I couldn\u2019t pinpoint it. The old man\u2019s pupils grew out and. His face sharpened and did not leave my eyes. He looked at Jules once more.\n\n\u201cI take it then that you know the price?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWe have it in full,\u201d she replied.

The purple seal disengaged and he opened the case.\n\n\u201cThis rifle has the power to clear a whole mountain top in one shot,\u201d the old man said, removing the glass cases in front of the gun. It was sleek black with purple lines running down the barrel. There was a small S at the end of the stock that looked like it had been carved in with a knife.\n\n\u201cWhere is the scope on it?\u201d Jules asked. The top of the gun was bare and I wondered if the old man was playing tricks on us.\n\n\u201cThe user of this rifle didn\u2019t ever use a scope,\u201d the old man said. He wiped down the rifle looking down at it.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jules said, \u201cHow did he aim? How is the rifle so highly enchanted then?\u201d\n\nWe both moved a couple of steps back from the old man. He hadn\u2019t moved. He looked like he was studying the rifle. I caught the engraved \u2018S\u2019 from the line of his sight.\n\n\u201cHe was blind. Sonic from the Military Project Phantom used his hyper sense of hearing in order to shoot targets. This particular rifle he used while laying down on a mountain top. He synced up his hearing with Captain Slyx and killed a target over 10,000 miles away where the rest of his team was fighting in the volcanic region. It can be dangerous in the wrong hands. It\u2019s yours now.\u201d\n\nThe old man handed the rifle up to Jules and she held it in her hands. Jules just stared down at the rifle and I handed the old man his payment. We walked to the back of the hallway and he led us to a different door from where we had come from.\n\n\u201cHow do you know about this?\u201d I asked him, \u201cNot anyone would know about Project Phantom. Not even we did.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m an old man. I hear things here and there. I\u2019ve been places. You learn some things in old age,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cWho were the rest of the members of Phantom?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking too much of an old man. You\u2019re lucky enough that I have such a rifle in my store.\u201d He replied. He gave me a quick smile and I felt my blood chill up. I looked over at Jules stuffing the gun in its case.\n\n\u201cI hope we can buy from you again mister.\n\n\u201cI hope so as well.

The squat, square structures were all precisely placed in orderly rows, but completely lacking in any color or personality, much like the residents themselves. The good people of Bleakstone were the serious, earnest, straight-laced, rule-following type. The type of people that Johan never really could believe existed without witnessing it for himself. Case in point: despite it being well after midnight, the village elder Boggs who was acting as his guide insisted on keeping to the walking street even when the wagon street would be much faster.\n\n\"Couldn't we just cross it, just this once?\" Johan asked after being guided the long way around a third intersection.\n\n\"Everything in order, holiness,\" the elder responded. That particular phrase was really starting to wear on Johan. Everything in order. He probably heard that at least thirty times a day. And as if that weren't enough, elder Boggs proceeded to launch into a long explanation on how carts and wagons must keep to the wagon path, and if people were to always be in their way, they might think they can go around using the walking path, and then where would we be. Chaos!\n\nHonestly Johan was delighted to have been appointed the head priest of the Holy Order of the Goddess Magdeline in Bleakstone. It had been a substantial promotion, one he would have had to wait years for back in the Chantry. But it had come with some substantial drawbacks. Bleakstone interpreted an off-handed statement from ol' Maggy about not letting magical power go to your head to mean that all magic was completely forbidden. That left this town completely without the amenities of magical modern life. No toilets, no showers, no air conditioning, they were basically medieval. The lack of air conditioning honestly bothered him the most. Bleakstone was muggy and hot all year long. Johan still used magic of course, but the townspeople resented him for it, even though the entire reason this town even had a certified priest was because they need someone who could perform exorcism spells. Although true exorcisms were extremely complex and difficult spells, quite beyond Johan's abilities. And there were theological differences. The Bleakstoners saw the goddess Magdeline as something incomprehensible and terrifying. She was, but to Johan, Maggy was a person you could talk to. And you better not let a Bleakstoner hear you calling their goddess \"Maggy\". All that together had left Johan completely unable to make any friends in the city. Any human friends, that is...\n\nFinally, Cleric Johan and elder Boggs arrived at their destination. Another squat gray house, exactly like all the others, except this one had another elder, Brent, waiting outside to greet them. Even if he weren't the only other person outside at this hour, Johan would've known this was the place by the expression elder Brent wore. From the most backwater village in the Empire to the middle of the Chantry, everyone kind of has the same look on their face when these things happened. Not a little fear, but also a small smile, as if we were sharing a terrible secret. There's *evil* here.\n\nJohan stepped inside with only a nod for elder Brent. In the main room, a teenage girl sat tied tightly to a chair. Johan knew her, Clarise. She was about four years younger than him. She was pretty, fair-haired, and like most of the girls in Bleakstone, heart-breakingly dull. And her eyes glowed with a black deathlight that cast the entire room in a unnatural shadow that obscured features but sharpened outlines. She was a mess, covered in grime, bleeding from the mouth, and hair all in a tangle. Johan couldn't decide if this was a step up or down from the way she normally looked. At least it wasn't boring.\n\n\"Johan? Is that you?\" Clarise asked in the demon tongue, her voice echoed by a deep, rasping voice that seemed to come from everywhere at once.\n\n\"Signak! Bro! What's up, man?\" Johan intoned.\n\n\"Not much, I...\" Signak responded with a frown, \"Why are you talking like that?\"\n\n\"Doing my job, man. These guys don't know this language, but they think that I'm an exorcist, remember? Don't suppose you could like, play the part a little.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah man, of course,\" Signak responded with a shriek. He snarled and struggled against the restraints, even managing to float in the air a couple inches. The small group of elders who were standing back from the beginning were practically hugging the wall at this point.\n\n\"Cool thanks,\" chanted Johan, \"Anyways what are you up to? I didn't know you were in town. Also, you're a frost demon, right? Care to help me out with this heat?\"\n\nSignak thumped back down to the ground and went eerily still. A wicked grin spread across her face and Signak's evil laugh shook the room. Frost started to spread out from where Clarise's possessed body sat. The room went from swampy hot to refreshingly cool.\n\n\"Just doing my thing man,\" Signak finally responded, \"Made a pact with this one. I play messenger between her and her dead mom for a bit, and she let's me use her body for a day to try out doing human things. Pulling out my eyebrows, writing poetry in my own feces, eating jam... You know, human stuff.\"\n\n\u201cAlright, I hear you. You about done? The evil hour is only like a half hour away so your contract is almost up. Oh, and I\u2019m gonna pull out my spell cantrip. Can you pretend to be afraid of it?\u201d Johan shouted the last part, and pulled out the holy symbol he used as a magical aid. Signak played his part well. He burst out of his restraints, and retreated backwards up to the corner of the wall and the ceiling.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, I kind of lost track of time. I never got to try jam.\u201d Signak complained. \n\n\u201cI require jam!\u201d Johan shouted in the common tongue. Jam was promptly produced by a terrified townsman.\n\nJohan pulled Signak down to the floor, and with a hand on Clarise\u2019s throat, forced a spoonfull of jam into her mouth. \n\n\u201cOh angels teats this is incredible! No wonder you guys eat food! This is way better than feces!\u201d Signak grinned.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Pretend you hate it,\u201d Johan said, and put another spoonful into Clarise\u2019s mouth. \n\nFor the next few spoonfuls, Signak screamed and wretched. Finally, he vomited a filthy black ink that separated into hundreds of spiders when it hit the ground.\n\n\u201cThanks man,\u201d Signak said, \u201cOk I can do you a solid and get out of here, now.\u201d \n\nJohan pocketed the rest of the jam. They would just burn it if he gave it back. Then he cast a spell of light on his cantrip and started shouting bravely, \u201cOne more thing, Jizzrah the Foul is throwing a party in the Witchwood tomorrow. He would be pissed if he knew you were in town and didn\u2019t show. You gotta come!\u201d\n\nThe priestlight pressed against the deathlight in a dazzling burst of energy. This was Johan\u2019s favorite part of these things. The lights warred and mixed, creating bursts of sparks, and small explosions of cold flame.\n\nSignak screamed as if in pain, \u201cAwesome! See you then.\u201d\n\nThe light in the room returned to normal, and a free and tragically normal Clarise started sobbing. Her father rushed over to her. \u201cOh bless you! Bless you Cleric Johan!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust doing my job, sir. Just doing my job.\u201d\n\nedit: ok I added little more description to the final showdown here. And commented a couple more parts.

He was still a child when he showed up at our city, barely able to speak - not that that was unusual for a shark, even one who appeared to be well into his seventh year. The guards who found him, and assigned him to a family to raise, assumed he was a carcharodon, despite the fact that something was *off* about his markings, and even at such a young age, his body and tail were already improbably heavy with muscle. But they, like the rest of us, assumed it made no difference; he was a shark, so he would never amount to anything.\n\n\nPerhaps that's being a little harsh, but, unlike dolphins - our ruling class, but also the species of most known serial killers - or orcas - our enforcers, who also make up the overwhelming majority of the remaining serial killers - or even octopodes like me - society's inventors, its problem solvers, and the likeliest to bollocks up any given system for everyone else out of sheer boredom - sharks are good, solid citizens, probably because they're so fucking *thick*. They're evolutionary throwbacks, easily manipulated into doing the work no one else wants with nothing more than the promise of being able to keep their bellies full. That was why, eleven years after Ashur had shown up at our gates, everyone honestly had forgotten completely about him.\n\n\nUntil he took the Academy's entrance exams.\n\n\nThe rest of us could barely concentrate, with that now massive, hulking figure hunched awkwardly over a desk near the center of the examining hall. It was only the tests' extremely stringent rules that kept us from whispering amongst ourselves - no shark had ever even qualified on the pre-tests before, much less made it to the real ones. As I glanced briefly around the room before doing the best I could to turn my attention back to my own test, I noticed the looks of pure, raw fury on the faces of the others.\n\n\nAshur's exam score turned out to be the highest in our entering class, by a margin that couldn't be explained by the sheer magnitude of the distraction that his presence had caused. Despite being a shark, he was legitimately brilliant - and the fact that he was a meter and a half longer and significantly burlier than even the largest orca in our class kept him from being bullied over the fact that he was also legitimately *obnoxious*. He was always asking questions far beyond the level of the class, and sometimes outside its entire subject area. Many of them concerned why sharks were so looked down upon, why they didn't contest the way they were treated, how the rest of us could be so disdainful toward the collection of species who kept us in the lifestyle to which we were accustomed. I was lucky enough to share only one class with him, but at least once a week for the entire semester, even I contemplated ripping off my hectocotylus and shoving it down his throat just to shut him up.\n\n\nAt long last, though, we all graduated, and none of us had to put up with him again - because Ashur couldn't find a job, despite having the same credentials as all of us and better grades than most. It was the first time I had actually felt sorry for him, but that didn't stop me from making only a transparently insincere offer of help. He knew it, too - but then, he also brushed off the few offers from those who actually were sincere. The last time I spoke with him - even though it was only a few sentences - I realized how consuming the anger and resentment that burned inside him were, and that they would never let him accept anything the rest of us tried to do for him. I wondered if they had been there ever since he'd arrived and been forced into the company of those who were ultimately so unlike him, or if the Academy was what had really unleashed them.\n\n\nThe last time I spoke to him was far from the last time I saw him, though. We all saw him around the city, growing increasingly desperate and disheartened as he preached to ever-dwindling crowds of sharks whose marble-black eyes regarded him incuriously while he tried to incite them to be better, to embrace the inherent nobility of their species, to rise up against the conditions to which they were subjected.\n\n\nThen, one day, those crowds began growing, because he had found the key to success. The other sharks didn't care about the ideals he preached, about equality of opportunity and justice for all species, about rising up and claiming their rightful place of preeminence as the ocean's oldest denizens - but when he began talking about unlimited fatted seal for all his followers, they suddenly cared a *lot*. Still, the rest of us didn't think anything would come of it, until the day the sharks really did rise up against us.\n\n\nI was one of a small group who, taking refuge in the Academy library, finally decided to see if we could find an answer to the question of why Ashur was... what he was. We had to go back into some of our oldest texts, but, at last, there it was.\n\n\nDuring an era so long ago as to be considered mythological even when those texts had been published, the ocean was divided up amongst warring states, each led by a small cadre of sharks of a species said to be as intelligent as any delphinid - in fact, whose genius could approach even the level of those infathomable, near-immortal sages, the whales.\n\n\n*Megalodon* was what they were called. One of those texts even had an illustration of their markings, which matched Ashur's almost exactly - and beneath it was written, \"That nightmare cannot die, being eternal evil itself \u2014 horror, and pain, and chaos; there is no fighting them, no power can fight them, all that avails is flight.\u201d\n\n\nWell, right now, we're arming ourselves as best we can, determined to find out whether or not that's really true.

Well, because our conversations would get political oftentimes, and we didn\u2019t exactly see eye-to-eye on most matters.

The only conversation we ever really had that wasn\u2019t political was about Caesar cyphers, which at the time I was very interested in while nobody else would listen to my ramblings, except my grandfather. \n\nDespite my low expectations at his will reading, I was still taken aback by what little he did leave me: a single book. A book! Meanwhile my brothers were given enough money to live off of, I was given a heap of dead wood and ink. I was shocked. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe he despised me that much, that he would insult me with such an inheritance. I wasn\u2019t given the book right away, as the book was among the many others (that my aunt inherited) in his library. And we were given only the Dewey decimal system number it was given. My brothers laughed at me as I went to go get the one thing that my first and greatest political rival gave me.\n\nAs I was looking for the book, I pondered why he wanted me to have this specific book. Perhaps it had a certain title that would insult my beliefs. Perhaps it didn\u2019t exist and he wanted me to waste my time. Perhaps it was something that would try and side me to think more conservative. Whatever the case, I knew it had to have been a book that wasn\u2019t in any way important to him. If it were, it wouldn\u2019t be with all of his other books, but rather in his study where it would be easy to find. I did eventually find the book, and when I did this final belief was cemented. There was so much dust on the book that the cover was obstructed. I took a deep breath and blew off the dust.\n\nUnderneath the dust, the book was olive green. The fabric the cover was made of was soft to the touch, and it had a built-in bookmark made of a nylon-like fabric. I observed the composition of the cover for a while before looking at the title, covering it with my hand so I could take in grandfather\u2019s insult in a sudden rush. I removed my hand to find in golden letters:\n\n#*Life\u2019s Cheat Codes*\n\nI looked at the book in confusion. This definitely wasn\u2019t an insult. This definitely wasn\u2019t something that was politically loaded, or at least not from the title it wasn\u2019t. I opened the book to read it, but was only greeted with illegible nonsense. It was all random letters, none of it making sense. But then I remembered something. *Caesar cyphers*, I thought to myself. *He knew I had a thing for codes.* It didn\u2019t lessen the fact that he left me with practically nothing, but it gave me a project. \n\nWhen I got home, I started to decode the book. But then I saw that the first words were \u201cDear Daniel,\u201d and I realized this was meant to be seen by me, as my name is Daniel. I decided I would insert the message into a computer and decider it there, so that I would see it all at one time. I took the next month typing the code into my computer. When I finished I put it into an online decryption program, and pressed enter.\n\n*Dear Daniel,*\n\n*I know you\u2019re probably mad that your only present was a book. You probably think that the contents of this book are pointless or are just trying to convince you that you were wrong in one of our arguments. You probably only decided to decode this because you were bored, not interested by the title. I know you wouldn\u2019t be interested in the title as you are a skeptic, a thinker. You look past what you are given at face value and try to look for deeper meaning. You don\u2019t get excited except when someone is treading on your beliefs.*\n\n*And the thing is, nobody told you to believe what you do. You looked at the world and you took what you saw from it and came to your conclusions that way. You don\u2019t stick to your beliefs because that\u2019s all you know. You stick to your beliefs because you know the other side, but you know which is better. You may not remember it this way, but there were many times your beliefs were conservative in nature. But rather than agreeing with you, I purposefully took the other side, to get you to stand your ground, and you always did.*\n\n*Daniel, I believe you are one of the greatest political minds of your generation and mine. Your beliefs are backed by evidence, you take the issues to heart, and you have an extraordinary sense of justice. And you are a great persuasive speaker. Each and every time we would argue, I would always learn something new, my beliefs would change, my paradigm would shift. I know I never showed it, but that was because I  wanted to get you used to how stubborn politicians can be. That is the life you should pursue, and I wanted to prepare you for it.*\n\n*As for what I have left to you, do not dismiss the book as me explaining to you that you should be a politician. Within the rest of this book are rituals (I promise they aren\u2019t demonic) that you can perform to alter the world around you. At first, you will need a certain list of supplies to perform them, though these can usually be found in everyday life. But after a while your mind will become accustomed to these \u201ccheat codes\u201d, and you will be able to perform them on a whim. I suggest you use that YouTube thing you\u2019re always on to learn some meditation techniques, as you\u2019ll need them.*\n\n*I gave you this responsibility because you\u2019re the most worthy of my kin to hold it. I know you wouldn\u2019t dare overuse the power, like I did to obtain my love and fortune. I can\u2019t stop you from using it in such a way, but at least I know you\u2019ll be subtle with it if you do.*\n\n*Love, Grandpa*\n\nI sat back into my chair in shock. Not only was my grandfather\u2019s view of me absolutely different from what I thought, but he also left me with the power of the universe. I looked at the book. I knew then and there that I couldn\u2019t possibly just leave myself well off with the book. I knew then and there I wanted to change the world for the better, in a major way.

He was a Jack; natural middle-management type, he knew he would never be a top shot caller, but he still knew he was a face card. Unfortunately for him, that meant no matter how many workers he fucked in the ass, there was always the possibility that a King, Queen, or an Ace was coming to fuck him even harder.\n\nYou know, if you believe in the Birth Cards. I know most people don\u2019t, but I do.\n\nI looked around the room and saw the two Deuces doodling on their paper while pretending to take notes. Most of my friends were Deuces, they were characterized by reduced ambition, increased unpredictability, with disproportionate representation in the prison populace. Deuces Wild, you know. The 3s, they were starting to tear up, they couldn\u2019t handle having a Jack so visibly angry at them. The 9s had seated themselves closer to the Jack so that they could look down on the room, as though they were all part of the solution and not part of the problem. The only 10 in the room, well, he was salivating and I\u2019m pretty sure his dick was hard.\n\nThat 10 is a good friend of mine, which is odd, because I do not typically get along with 10s.

Consequently, that 10 is the only guy in the room, other than me, who knows what is really going on.\n_____\n\nLast night, I sat on my laptop in bed next to my fianc\u00e9 typing away on a dating site. I don\u2019t really know what you call an experienced and proficient catfisher \u2013 a master baiter? \u2013 but I was well on my way to becoming one. Tonight, I was pretending to be my fianc\u00e9 and carrying on an ongoing conversation. My girlfriend was a 7 \u2013 perfectly imbalanced and frequently unable to really drive after what they want.

As she settled down, I sent my new internet friend a picture of her bare ass bent over our table, a picture that she allowed me to take about a week ago. I knew that would drive the 6 crazy, it was conventional enough that they believed it would come from someone as timid and bloodless as my fianc\u00e9, but you could also see a bit of anus which would appeal to their need to push the envelope.\n\nThe best part about 6s is that they are not very patient, they wanted to meet, and soon. I chose the perfect park for a first meeting, mostly based on its location.\n\n____\n\nI never really plan things, I just keep my eyes open and the punchlines just sort of come to me. Think about the difference between a plan and a joke. A plan is a series of steps, critiqued by feasibility and risk, that lead to a desired end state. A joke, a good joke, comes from the gut. It\u2019s not absurd or illogical, instead it\u2019s a perfect nugget of wit that just smacks you in the face when you hear the right set up or see the right situation.

Typically, you are safe to walk the streets while compromised if you stick to the well-lit sidewalks outside of the bars and restaurants \u2013 then your only problem is some dick 10 cop deciding to bust you for public intoxication. Because that is so safe, me and Kyle never do it; we blew a hundred bucks on cheap whiskey and went to go hang out under a bridge that\u2019s popular with the less fortunate, less sheltered, and way less bathed Deuces of the world. \n\nWe had been there about an hour, my eyes were glazed over, and standing was proving difficult. I dropped down next to a man in a thick beard with serious eyes who had not touched a drop of whiskey all night.\n\nI called him a cunt. Then I apologized and specified that he was a cunt for not drinking with us and under other circumstances I would reserve judgement of his cuntery, but clearly based on the available evidence, he is a cunt.\n\nHe told me that he is not a clown sent to amuse me. I grinned because I know a few things about clowns.\n\nI told him that we should be friends. He smirked and said that if I was his friend I would listen to his story. So, he told me a hellish tale of covetous bottom feeders coming together to oust a decent man out of his own company, he told me about scandals and blackmail, and men with cameras snapping pictures of a decent man\u2019s daughter.\n\nI don\u2019t really remember all the fine points, I threw up half way through.

Then I barked with laughter. \"Jealous?! Ha! As if!\"\n\nThe door opened and the new guy slid inside, looking at us with his hand on the doorknob. \"Leave it closed or open?\" he asked - the Big 10 above his head as black as the bottom of a cauldron.\n\nSally answered, \"Be a dear and close it for me, hun. Then come get your coffee,\" she said, flirtation heavy in her voice. \"I made it extra sweet with lots of cream\" she added, glancing over her shoulder at him.\n\nHe was immune. \"Thanks, but I like it black,\" he said, grabbing his own cup and standing behind me.\n\n\"Actually, you can go ahead of me,\" I said, stepping aside. He nodded his thanks and took my spot.\n\nThe door opened again and our boss walked in - an independent, middle aged woman that looked like she was still in her early 20's. A green 6 rotated slowly above her head.\n\n\"Oh, there you are!\" she exclaimed, fixing her eyes solely on the new guy. \"I was actually looking for you. I need help with something in my office. Would you mind?\" she asked, though it was clear she was ordering. She even had the door already open to escort him out.\n\nHe frowned a bit, conflicted between his duty to obey the boss and his desire for a cup of coffee. The former option won out and he set his cup down reluctantly, walking out the held-open door. \n\nMaybe it was my imagination, but it looked to me like the boss had looked at his ass and licked her lips as she closed the door behind them.\n\nAs soon as the door clicked close, Sally turned to me and whisper-shouted, \"Did you see that? She was totally coming on to him! That bitch better not touch him or I swear...\" she muttered, taking an angry sip from her cup.\n\nSuddenly, I had a suspicion.\n\nI ran to the door, opened it, and peered out. The entire office of women were either already making their way over to the new guy or watching with clear lust in their eyes from a distance.\n\nSally brushed by me with the cup of coffee still in her hands, steamrolling her way over to the new guy and the boss, who was trying to order the other women back to work - and failing. \n\n*Oh, boy,* I thought, sharing a head shake with the few of the guys nearby who made eye contact. *If this guy has this effect on women, we're all in trouble.*\n", "author": "VanceValence"}, {"permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7h4yph/wp_you_joined_a_mob_the_boss_asks_you_to_prove/dqopjxy/", "score": 63, "prompt": " You joined a mob.

Make a splash.\"\n\nWithout turning, I nodded and made for the door.  It was definitely going to be in the news.  Goon 1 on the right who had laughed came a bit too close, so I broke his finger and held on, pulling him down with me as I punched the side of Goon 2's knee, who collapsed in pain.\n\nGoon 1 took both barrels from the shotgun that the Boss Lady had under her desk.  He stared in shock at his arm laying on the floor, inches from his face.  He didn't seem to care much as I pulled his gun out and put a bullet in the brain of Goon 2 trying to reach his own gun.\n\nI swung the barrel around and fired, catching the Boss Lady in the middle of her large chest.  The shotgun dropped from her hands, along with the shells she had been trying to put in.\n\nI stood and walked over to her.

How a guy with a nickname like that could become the head of the family I don't know, but I learned long ago not to ask questions.  A guy stayed healthier that way.  \n\nGino started to talk.  \"You've proven that you can make money and do it quietly.  The family appreciates that.  We want to show you our appreciation.  But before we do that you have to do one last thing for us.  Think of it as a loyalty test.\"\n\nI was stunned.  I hadn't thought anyone had been paying attention to my work for the capo.  I watched as the Putz ate his spaghetti without a spoon and sprayed his sauce everywhere.  I tried to hide my revulsion as he finished a mouthful, thankful that he was swallowing before talking again.  I could tell that he was waiting for me to speak but I knew better.  I never spoke unless I was answering a question.  It's another way I've stayed healthy this long.\n\n\"So here's what I want you to do.  You're dating somebody right?\"\n\n\"Yes sir, I've been seeing a young lady for a few weeks now.\"\n\n\"OK that's good, you're not too attached.  We want you to waste her.\"\n\nI blinked.  I coughed.  The family had never asked me to do anything like this before. I wasn't made, they had people for this sort of thing. And there was another problem. \"You want me to kill the girl I'm dating?\"\n\n\"What are you deaf?  Yes I want you to prove your loyalty to us by killing your girlfriend.  Are you saying you can't do that for us?\"\n\n\"Well it's like this boss.  This is kind of awkward because the girl I'm dating....\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well, she's your daughter if that picture over there is anything to go by.  Either that or she's a close family friend.\"\n\nNow it was Gino that was coughing. Then he stared at me again.  \"Well, you've got guts admitting that to me.  The boys thought you'd agree and then hit the road for Mexico.\"\n\n\"You knew?\" I was shocked.  I could see the Putz's guards chuckling to themselves. \n\n\"Of course I knew you schmuck.\"\n\n\"So you don't actually want me to kill her right? This was just a joke?\"\n\nThe Putz turned deadly serious all of a sudden.  \"Oh the hit is still on.  If you don't kill her you can forget ever showing yourself above ground again, capiche?\"\n\n\"I don't get it?  She's your daughter.\"\n\n\"Its like this.  She knows not to date anyone in the family.  That's eh, what you call it, incestuous.  I love my little girl but the family comes first.\"\n\nI knew right there why he was called Gino the Putz.  I also knew there was no future for me in the family.  Some day this jackass would find a reason to kill him too.  I wasn't stupid though.\n\n\"OK boss, if that's what you wish.\"\n\n\"It is.  Now get out of my sight.\"\n\nI walked out of the restaurant where we had met.  I walked down the street and hailed a cab.  Once I was home I waited half an hour and then I called another cab.

Quite possibly the worst student I have had the displeasure to educate in my fifteen years at the university.\n\n\"Professor Adams?\"\n\n\"For the last time, Mr. Callahan, if you wanted a passing grade, you should have turned in the lab work. Or perhaps even completed the lab work in the first place. I can teach all I want, but if a student doesn't want to learn, that's not my problem.\"\n\n\"But Professor-\"\n\n\"Mr. Callahan, I am not about to raise your grade simply because you asked nicely.\"\n\n\"This isn't about my grade.\"\n\nOf all the things he could have said to me at that moment, he could only have surprised me more by actually turning in an assignment.\n\n\"Very well, what is it that you would like to discuss?\"\n\n\"Could I do my research on something I've already done?\"\n\nYes, because there is absolutely a topic he's researched in the past.\n\n\"Well, that depends on the topic, and how much you can still explore on that topic.\"\n\n\"Faster-than-light travel.\"\n\n\"Mr. Callahan, I would appreciate it if you would refrain from wasting my time on a practical joke.\"\n\n\"This isn't a joke!\"\n\nIf it weren't illegal, I would have strangled him.\n\n\"You are failing this class. If you want to have a chance at passing, I advise you to take this project seriously, as it is the last major assignment for the semester.\"\n\n\"This isn't a prank! I actually discovered FTL travel last night!\"\n\n\"If I wanted science fantasy, I would read the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, not a student's paper. Now, if there is nothing else, Mr. Callahan, I have lab reports to grade. The door is to your left. Please make use of it.\"\n\nIn reality, I had finished grading them last night, but sometimes, one is willing to say anything to get a problem student out of one's hair. I grabbed a meaningless stack of papers from the corner of my desk, expecting him to leave as I began to supposedly work. After approximately thirty seconds of flipping through the stack, hovering above each paper with a red pen, I looked up to see him still standing there.\n\n\"How dense are you? I understand that you are not the most intelligent student by any stretch of the imagination, but you really must learn to take a hint.\"\n\n\"I can prove to you that I discovered FTL travel.\"\n\n\"I am not going to humor this fantasy of yours. Get out.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThis child is insufferable! It is one thing to not care about one's own education, but to waste my own time trying to deal with him is simply ridiculous!\n\n\"How can I get you to leave?\n\n\"Let me prove to you that I built an FTL drive.\"\n\n\"Fine. If it will take less time than convincing you to leave logically and stop wasting both of our time, show me this 'FTL drive.' \"\n\n\"I have it here.\"\n\nHe reached into his bag and retrieved a black oblong box with various multicolored wires extending from it and what looked like an old television remote.\n\n\"Tell me, Mr. Callahan, how is this device supposed to be operated?\"\n\n\"Well, professor, first, we put something touching the drive, like, say, your red pen.\" He placed the pen on top of the box. \"Then, I input a direction and a distance,\" he continued, pressing numbers on the remote, \"and activate it by pressing this button here.\"\n\nWith that, he pressed the \"ok\" button on the remote. For the first few moments, nothing happened.\n\n\"This has been a very elaborate prank, Mr. Callahan. Now If you've had your laugh-\"\n\nAs I spoke, the pen began to glow, then shot off and embedded itself into my leg with a streak of light.\n\n\"Oops,\" he said as I collapsed, howling in pain. \"Miscalculated.\"\n\nEdit: a comma", "author": "Doom_Shark"}]
