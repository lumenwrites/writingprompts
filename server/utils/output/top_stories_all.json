While I checked their IDs, their gazes would frequently flicker over to their friends for support. The more jittery among them would chatter away with quotes plucked directly from the latest Fortune magazine or how \"buying their own place was the best thing to happen to them\". If only they knew they weren't the only ones saying those things ...\n\nInevitably, after about fifteen seconds of my careful, silent scrutiny of their spotless plastic cards, the first tracks of sweat would begin to appear on their foreheads. Their conversations would die down, and the fidgeting multiply. The desperate ones would say, with frequent glances over my shoulder at doorway through which pulsing lights and throbbing music emerged, \"Could we, uh, hurry up? Our friends are waiting for us inside.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but you're underage. This ID isn't valid,\" I said.\n\nSometimes, I wished I could just tell them the truth\u2014that I could identify crap-all about them from the card. The printed numbers meant little against the large , glimmering digits floating above their heads. It'd taken me several childhood years and the help of a mirror to figure them out, but they made me damned good at my job.\n\n\"This can't be right,\" the young man said, jaws tightening even as a visible, nervous shudder coursed through his body.\n\n\"I'm guessing, seventeen?\" I almost laughed at his shocked expression. Jerking my thumb toward his older male companion, I said, \"Your brother'll just have to take you elsewhere.\"\n\n\"C'mon, let's go,\" the other man said, pulling him out and shooting me one last dirty look.\n\nSuch was the life of a street-level NYC bouncer. As I was writing down the ID's details on a register, I heard the clicking of heels approach. Next moment, a slim, small hand slid an ID card onto my podium.\n\nI looked up and did a double-take\u2014literally jumping back a step. She was pretty, more girl-next-door than supermodel, with loose auburn hair hanging to her shoulders framing a lean face. About five feet tall, she wore a tight-fitting black dress that terminated at mid-thigh, though her figure wasn't anything more spectacular than I'd been seeing for the past hour or so.\n\nSo, your typical college girl lookalike ... but for the number above her head.\n\nThree thousand and nine.\n\nWhat. The. Hell.\n\n\"There might be an issue with your age,\" I blurted before I could stop myself.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" she said in a faintly European accent. Other than her mouth, the rest of her hadn't moved at all\u2014even the fingers clutching the purse in front of her were like cold marble. I could feel goosebumps popping up on my arms as I reached for her ID.\n\n\"Sorry, just give me a moment to check,\" I said, darting furtive looks at the age number above her head as though I expected it to change at any time. I'd never been wrong before; perhaps this was the first time?\n\nHer name was Helena Ricci. Born here in the US twenty-two years ago. I ran the scanner over it. Clean. Shit.\n\n\"Er, I'll need just a moment to register you into our system,\" I said.\n\n\"Take your time. I've got plenty,\" she said. Her eyes remained cold above her smile.\n\nOnce the process was complete, I handed the card back to her. \"Have a pleasant evening.\"\n\nShe took the card and stalked off into the club. I felt tempted to go after her\u2014so many questions were in my head\u2014but that would mean revealing my gift. And one didn't go around spouting such nonsense so easily, so my dad had warned me.\n\nSo I threw my attention back to the impatient and growing line of patrons waiting for me.\n\n***\n\nThe hours flew by. I kept an eye out for Helena among the clubbers trickling out. Once, I thought I saw her in the midst of a small group of men, who went and lounged by a Levante parked not far away. They smoked for a while before returning to the club.\n\nAt about four in the morning, when activity was visibly slowing down, she left the club, flashing me a grin on the way. That, more than anything, helped make up my mind.\n\n\"Helena,\" I called, jogging from my post to catch up to her. \"I've got something I want to ask you.\"\n\nShe paused in her step, but maintained her distance out of my arm's reach. \"Yes?\"\n\nI tore my eyes away from her numbers and met her searching gaze. \"How old are you?\"\n\nShe snorted. \"Really? We're still not over this?\"\n\n\"I can see people's ages, above their heads,\" I said in a rush. \"I've always been able to\u2014since I was a child. And I see that you're\u2014\"\n\n\"Quiet!\" she snapped, looking around almost fearfully. \"You must be dreaming, or imagining things. I'm only twenty-two, recently graduated\u2014\"\n\n\"That's bullshit,\" I said. \"I've never been wrong. I know what I see. And I'm most definitely not high or anything.\"\n\nShe scoffed. \"Stay away from me, mister. I've got Mace here in my purse.\" With that, she hurried away.\n\n\"I told you my secret. Don't I deserve a little truth from you?\" I said.\n\nShe stopped in her tracks and turned her head halfway. \"I never agreed to a trade.\"\n\n\"I won't say anything to anyone, I promise,\" I said. \"I just\u2014seeing you is almost the same as NASA revealing that alien life exists on the Moon or something. Can't you imagine what it's like for me?\"\n\nFor a long time, she remained quiet. I could almost see the gears turning in her head. At last, she said softly, \"Fine. Come, I'll show you.\"\n\nElated, I followed. She didn't speak to me as we traversed the silent, shadowy streets, but I held my tongue as well. If I asked one question too many, she could turn me away.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, we arrived at an unmarked red door in a back alley, sandwiched between two dumpsters. I frowned at our surroundings, suddenly realizing that if she wanted to rob me\u2014or worse\u2014I wouldn't be discovered until the next week probably.\n\nShe knocked on the door, but instead of a rapping sound, musical notes floated from somewhere inside. Then, it swung open to reveal a heavily bearded giant of a man. His fierce gaze took one look at Helena before his expression melted with warmth, and he wrapped his arms around her.\n\n\"Who is this?\" he said.\n\n\"With luck, someone smart enough to keep his life,\" she said.\n\nI tried not to gulp as the man held out a brick-like hand for me to shake. \"I'm Olander,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm Jeff, pleased to\u2014holy crap, you're over a thousand years old,\" I said.\n\nHe blinked in astonishment. \"How did you know? Oh, Helena, what have you brought us?\"\n\n\"He might be useful. Shall we go in?\" she said.\n\nOlander led us into a long, stone tunnel with an arched ceiling. It looked extremely cramped for the big man, but he hunched his shoulders in a manner that indicated familiarity. The two of them spoke in a language I didn't know. Somewhere in the distance, there was a constant gush of water\u2014perhaps we were near one of the city's waterways?\n\nMoments later, we reached another door, this one made entirely of solid, carved wood. I had only begun to marvel at its surface when Olander pushed it in and revealed the chamber within.\n\nI gaped, open-mouthed, at the twelve Roman columns supporting a ceiling of painted frescoes, spaced around the cavernous place lit by huge chandeliers and colorful wall-mounted lanterns. In the center of the room was a fountain almost ten feet tall, crystalline water spilling from the top into three descending circular pools and sparkling with light.\n\nPeople of various races and attire filled the room, mingling in small groups; eating from the buffet tables, drinking, admiring paintings hanging on a section of wall, or listening to an orchestral quartet on a small stage.\n\nAnd above all, I was stunned at the numbers everywhere. Two thousand and eighty-two. One thousand five hundred. One thousand and six. Three\u2014freaking three\u2014thousand, seven hundred and forty-four.\n\n\"How?\" I stammered. \"What is this?\"\n\nHelena didn't answer except to point at the fountain. And then it dawned one me. Before I could inquire further, she pulled me back out of the chamber into the tunnel.\n\n\"Would you be interested in a new job here at our club?\" she said.\n\n\"I, er ... what job?\"\n\n\"Doorman.\" She sighed. \"You see, we can't have too many of ... us ... running around the world. Defeats the purpose of actively staying out of the history books, if you know what I mean. Anyone below a thousand must not be allowed in\u2014sometimes, it's really hard to tell. But you already know that with your current job.\"\n\n\"I'll have to think about it,\" I said. My head felt like it was about to split apart. Those people ... some of their clothes looked like they predated writing. \"Are there ... younger people ... trying to get in, too?\"\n\n\"More than you know,\" she said in a grave tone. \"Olander takes care of them, usually, but it's really insulting if you turn away the wrong patrons. And grudges can last for a long time with us.\"\n\n\"Well, you already know we have a great healthcare package, networking opportunities, insurance and investment returns. I won't pressure you to give me an answer tonight,\" she said, going to stand in the doorway. \"Take your time. I'm in no hurry.\"\n\n***\n\n*Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it.

Each thought they were meeting a client, both were told to never break act.\n\nI sat at the table next to theirs, twirling a stainless steel pen with the letters *Goldman Sachs* gilded on. The girl, Anna, was the first to arrive. A tight black skirt hugged her figure. The skirt was short, but work-appropriate short. She was the best prostitute *Fuck You* money could buy which meant she was the best in the world. She turned her wrist and checked a silver Rolex. It was a Daytona model. She had certainly done her research.\n\nThe guy, Brandon, soon followed. He wore a navy blue suit without a single crinkle. I glanced down at his shoes. Brooks Brothers, custom-made. It looked hand-crafted even. A smile touched my lips as he sat down and extended his hand for a handshake.\n\n\u201cAnna, was it?\u201d Brandon said. \u201cThanks for meeting me, my name\u2019s Brandon, VP at JPMorgan Chase, housing division.\u201d\n\nAnna returned him a firm shake. \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m a VP at Merrill Lynch, risk division.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at us, if our bosses found us here. They\u2019d have our bonuses.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and took a sip of wine. \u201cSo, I was told that you had a business proposal for me?\u201d\n\nThis was it, the reason I had dropped five figures on two prostitutes. Brandon would fumble through banking buzz words and financial pseudo-sciences as I sat back, laughing at his stupidity. Then Anna would follow in their dance of idiocrasy, all the way until they left *La Bernadin*, never to return because they couldn\u2019t afford even its dress code. My pen twirled in anticipation.\n\n\u201cCredit default swaps,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cIt\u2019s insurance against bad loans. So if we make a string of bad investments, even when we lose, we make money, just not as much.\u201d\n\nAnna furrowed her brow. \u201cI work risk at Merrill Lynch, I know how to lower risk.\u201d\n\nA giggle tickled my throat. What would a prostitute know about credit default swaps? He probably read the first Wikipedia paragraph and now thought himself an expert. I wondered who would be the bigger idiot, Brandon or Anna?\n\n\u201cWhat if we pair that up with thousands of high-risk loans?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike we already do?\u201d Anna asked.\n\n\u201cBut not *individually*.\u201d Brandon leaned forward, his voice lowered so I had to strain my ears just to hear his words. \u201cWe pool them all together and then securitize them into a single asset. Tell me Anna, what happens when you bundle risk?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt drops,\u201d Anna said. \u201cBut those have been around for a while now. Are you proposing that we just keep doing what we\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\nBrandon frowned. It looked like Anna had done more research than him. I pretended to cough to stifle my laughter. It was he who would look the fool!\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Anna said, \u201cbut how about we talk to the ratings agencies. The bigger the pool of assets, the lower the risk. If we get a big enough pool, any sort of shitty asset could have a triple-A rating.\u201d\n\nMy jaw dropped and I broke character by staring straight at her. The two didn\u2019t even notice, they were so buried in their conversation.\n\n\u201cWe can lower it further by having it asset-backed. Like a car loan,\u201d Brandon said, his voice rising with his excitement.\n\n\u201cLike a mortgage!\u201d Anna said. \u201cWe can sell janitors million dollar houses on loans they\u2019ll never pay off, pool all those loans together, and then sell them off as a Triple-A asset before they crash and burn.\u201d\n\nMy fingers trembled, but not with the same excitement I had purchased. They were right. Banks could securitize all these shitty mortgages and their value would rise because their ratings would, even though the risk technically stayed exactly the same. My pen dropped to the napkin in front of me and I wrote a single phrase into it before slipping it in my pocket and leaving.\n\n*Sub-prime mortgages.*\n\n---\n\n---\n\n/r/jraywang for daily WP stories, continuations by popular demand, and more!"}, {"author": "wercwercwerc", "score": 14466, "prompt": " You live in a world where each lie creates a scar on the liar's body.

Never met anyone quite like him since, never really expect I will either.\n\nPeople like Joe don't come around often. Once in a lifetime maybe, if you're lucky.\n\nAlmost everyone I've ever met had the tiny silvered papercuts of white-lies on their fingers. It's a price of formalities, a camouflage of sorts- as everyone has a few, some deeper cut than others over the years; opened and reopened time after time. And not just that, but the larger cuts, silvery things on forearms and shins, necks or backs. People lie, it's just the way of things.\n\nSometimes the pain it worth the deception, the balancing scale plays out mentally before a person's mouth opens.\n\nJoining the force was what I wanted. There was a lie I told myself: A Lie I scratched in deep, over and over again. I wanted to change, I wanted my parents to be proud: All lies, tiny scratching lines on my shoulder to create a strange and deceitful pattern that never seemed to heal completely.\n\nIn truth, I joined the force because I had nothing left. I joined as a last ditch effort to save myself from rock bottom. Among the elite, surrounded by the brave and the successful, I simply kept my head down. It felt like being a fox, stuck among a pack of wolves. Just being there in the first place felt like deception.\n\nBut then, there was instructor Joe.\n\nI had more scars than most, and that earned little trust- but if people were politely cold with me, they were visibly frigid with Joe. See, he didn't have the traditional marks on his hands, he didn't have cuts and nicks along his arms, his face or neck: At a quick glance you might have thought him the most honest man alive. In fact, at first people did. A man in his fading thirties without scars? \n\nThat's like a god-damn unicorn. They're more myth and legend than person- yet there he was. Plain as day.\n\nEveryone liked Joe that first week. Everyone wanted to be on good terms with him- I mean, who wouldn't? In a world of liars and cheats, proof reminded at every twist and turn of the road, who wouldn't want someone they could trust? \n\nWell, that was before he took of his shirt in the locker-room. Before we all saw the hideous mark that covered half his back. One lie, but the most gruesome thing I've ever seen. From his shoulder blade to his ribs, it looked like a crashing comet of red and silvered white. A tiny portion of it just finally healing, a rough tear now recovered again.\n\nIt was all the same lie. That's something you can just tell sometimes, just know it. Usually you can tell how many times too, but whatever the number was which he'd said *that* aloud, I don't know. \n\nHe rarely spoke to begin with, issuing the orders with a stern smile, instructing as all the rest did. He was positive, encouraging, truthful: But that scar was on everyone's mind. Deep, dark, and terrible: Someone who could tell a lie like that... Well, there was someone to watch out for. In the end though, it was at the range when things went well and truly sour.\n\nLive-fire runs, we'd done them a thousand times, but that day I guess someone forgot themselves. Maybe they thought too much on *what* and *how* and their brain skipped a beat, or maybe they were just careless. Regardless of the reason, a shot fired when it shouldn't have. Brass spit fire, Air swallowed metal, and lead took its first taste of iron, calcium, iron and dirt.\n\nIn that order.\n\nWe all stopped, eyes wide and watching that kid fall down real slow. First standing, staring with his hand pulling away- not even scared, just shocked. Red, like deep crimson soaking and spreading, he dropped down to his knees. Still, he wasn't even there yet, it hadn't quite processed.\n\nThat's when Joe caught him- and all the shouting erupted. The pandemonium, the first real training turned to action kicking in. Cries for \"Medic!\" and \"KIT! Get the kit!\" as people ran for the directions they thought mattered.\n\nI was close enough to know that wasn't going to make a difference. Center of mass was what we trained for, the reason was straight and forward: Shoot to kill. Eliminate the target and move on.\n\nSo I sat there, weapon heavy in my hands as I watched Joe hold this kid, blood pouring out into the dirt like a faucet, and I listened to him repeat the words that cut deep. Over, and over, and over again.\n\n*\"Hang on, look at me.

I was 13 when I saw the brightly colored lines cutting straight across the gravel parking lot, leading me back to my parents after I had gotten lost on that road trip.  But before that?  I really couldn't say.  Maybe I had seen them before, mistaking them for pavement lines and supermarket markings.\n\nRegardless.  After I noticed them, I couldn't help it.  I saw them *everywhere*.  Two lines, red and green, etched into the ground like they were marked in paint.  No one else could see them.  I'd commented on them once, to my mother, and she looked at me like I was crazy.  I was old enough at that point to know to keep my mouth shut.\n\nBut I watched, as they wove their way in and out of my life.\n\nAnd, as one does, I inevitably found myself overwhelmed with the *need* to investigate them, to see where they led.  The curiosity was more than I could take.  The memory of that first time was too fresh in my mind, of the green line leading me straight back to safety.\n\nAnd so, when I was 14, I grabbed a botle of water and a snack, and I followed them.  The green line, of course.  Green is good and red is bad, right?  It just seemed smarter that way.  It had taken me on a winding, twisting path, deeper and deeper into the city, until at last I found myself at a robotics tournament being held that afternoon.  \n\nIt was *thrilling*.\n\nI had no idea that something like that was even a thing, but my interest was piqued.  I decided - I wanted to do something like *that* with my life.  And I looked at that little green line with newfound respect.\n\nSo I followed it again.\n\nOver and over, I followed it.  And time after time, my life was rewarded for it.  It took me to the front door of a prep school where I met Mr. Graves, whose tutoring I hold directly responsible for getting me into college a few years down the road.  It led me out of danger, as a kitchen fire burned out of control in my school.  And, it crossed my path with that of the woman of my dreams.  Literally.  We smacked into each other in a crosswalk.\n\nSo, here I was.  I was 30, and the world was at my fingertips.  I sat in my leather gaming chair, in front of the desk holding all of my equipment.  I looked out the window of my top-floor penthouse, gazing down at the city below.  The walls were covered with the awards I had won, in automation and robotics and system design.  My lovely, smart, beautiful wife was in the other room, reading a book as she brewed coffee.\n\nIt was perfect.  Really perfect.  All thanks to that little green line.\n\nBut I couldn't help it.  I was *bored*.  \n\nMy whole adult life, I'd relied on that invisible line to guide my steps.  It hadn't bothered me when I was younger.  I was just a kid, and this line opened doors for me I didn't even know *existed*.  I'd followed it without hesitation, trusting it to take my life where it needed to go.\n\nNow that I was older, now that I had time to stop and think about it, I wondered if this had all really been for the best.  Had I just taken the easy path?  Had I gone with the flow, and given up on taking my life into my own hands?  It kept me up at night, I'll be honest.\n\nAnd through it all, it burned, in the corner of my vision.  That red line.  It seared into my sight like it was on *fire*.  It demanded attention, begging for me to give it the shot I'd only ever given its green brother.\n\nThat old curiosity was back.\n\nAnd so I grabbed an old messenger bag out of the closet, a remnant from my college days.  I threw in bottles of water, and a pocket knife.  A charge cable for my phone, and a granola bar.  I laughed to myself, as I saw it.  It looked so much like the bag I had packed, all those years ago, when I first walked the green line.  But that felt right, you know?\n\nI slipped out the door, with a quick goodbye to my wife.  She accepted my excuses of taking a walk without hesitation, pressing a kiss to my cheek and wishing me a good day.  I smiled to myself, as I left the house.  She was the best thing that the green line had ever gotten me.\n\nAnd then I stepped onto the red line.\n\nOnce again, it led me into the city, deeper and deeper.  But where the green line had taken me straight towards the center of activity, leading me towards schools and conference centers, the red line seemed to be taking me right to the worst part of town.  I flinched away from seedy glares, eyeing my bag and the make of my coat, as I hurried onwards.\n\nI hoped this wasn't going to be the last mistake I ever made.\n\nThe buildings around me loomed higher, the roads and streets giving way to narrow alleys.  I was *about* to give up, to declare this a fool's errand and turn back.\n\nAnd then I heard her crying.\n\n\"Please.  Please, no.  I swear I won't say anything.  I don't have any money, I- I don't have *anything*.  Please just let me go and I swear I won't ever-\"\n\n\"Shut it.\"\n\nThe woman's voice was high, reedy with fear, and her tears threatened to overwhelm her words entirely.  It stopped me in my tracks, before I even had a chance to hear *him* speak.\n\nThe voices were coming from ahead.  The red line burned, inviting me onwards.\n\nAlmost against my will, I found my feet moving fowards.  And then I saw her, huddled on the ground in a mass of scarf and hair.  A man was in front of her, kneeling, with her purse torn open in front of him.  He dug through it, tossing receipts and makeup cases aside carelessly as he looked for anything valuable.\n\nIn his other hand, he held a gun.  It pointed at her lazily, weaving back and forth as he eviscerated the bag.\n\nThey were right there, no more than twenty feet in front of me.  Neither of them saw me.  The man's back was to me, and the woman was in no state to notice.  \n\nMy hand plunged into the bag slung over my shoulder, latching reflexively around the familiar shape of my knife.  I didn't know what I was going to do with it, but having it in my hand made me feel a *little* better.\n\nI needed to call the cops.  This was all wrong.  There was no way I could do anything to help her.  I was just going to end up getting her killed, or myself, or both of us.  He had a *gun*.  What could I *possibly* do against-\n\nHis hand swayed, the barrel pointing back at her.  His finger tensed on the trigger.\n\nBefore I had time to think, I was running.  The knife was out of the bag now, gleaming in my hand as I thrust it towards him.  Towards his neck.  If I could knock him over, if I could get that gun pointed *away* from her-\n\nI swore colorfully as I stumbled.  The man grunted in surprise and pain, as my knife dug into his wrist.  I winced, even as I ran headlong into him.  Turns out my aim with a knife *sucked*.\n\nBut it got the job done.  He fell, cursing and screaming, as blood flowed from his wrist.  The gun clattered to the cold pavement, forgotten, as he stumbled back.  His eyes were locked onto my knife, through the mist of pain I could see in his expression.  \n\n\"What the *fuck*?\"  He cursed again, clutching his wrist.  \"Dude, fuck *off*.\"\n\nI swiped the knife at him clumsily, more threatening than actually intending to hit him.  He swore one last time, jumping back.  \"Fuck this.  Keep your shitty purse, lady.\"  With one last parting jab, he spun on his heel and vanished rapidly down the alleys.\n\nThe woman was a mess, eyes all red and sniffling desperately.  But she pulled herself together as I approached her, beginning to tuck her belongings back into her bag.\n\n\"Are...are you ok, ma'am?\"  I asked tentatively, my voice low.  She glanced up at me, smiling.\n\n\"I am now.  That asshole.  I- I was so *scared*.  Thank you *so* much.  Thank you.  I don't know what would have happened if you-\"  \n\n\"Don't worry about it.

My stomach roiled.  *More*?\n\nThe noise of the city was returning to normal around us, as we returned to some semblance of civilization.  I began to relax, just a hair.  And then, as we turned towards the main street, I hesitated.\n\nThe red line was turning, down a different alley.  It led half a block down, and then cut straight up to the front door of a little shack.\n\nI could see a tiny, hazy tendril of smoke, rolling out from under the side door.\n\nThe line *burned*, screaming red in its urgency.  It seared a line into my vision as I looked down the alley.  I paused, caught deep in thoughts.  Questions, that had been lingering in my head for years, and answers that had suddenly become apparent.\n\nThe green line took me where *I* needed to go.  It showed me the easy path.  The path that I needed to take.\n\nWhat if...What if the red line showed me the hard path?  Not the path that I needed, but the path that other people needed me to take?  What if it took me to where other people needed me to go?\n\n\"Can you manage from here?\"  I heard my voice say, ringing distant in my own ears.  The woman glanced back to me, smiling faintly.\n\n\"I think so.  Do you have to go?\"\n\n\"I..I think I do, yeah.\"  I didn't look back at her.  My eyes were still locked onto that little building.  The smoke was growing, swelling by the second.  I half turned, releasing the woman's hand and giving her a reassuring smile.  She returned it shyly, waving as she merged back into the flow of pedestrians and made for the police station.\n\nI turned back to the red line.

Every apology was a glimmer of hope that the woman he'd fallen in love with would return. Every insult she spat and object she hurled made him wonder if she was ever there, or if it had all been a dream. \n\nHe stood up slowly and turned to go into the house. *If I were more understanding, more giving, patient, she'd remember what we had and come back,* he thought. He'd had thousands of similar thoughts. He was a fixer. Maybe he could fix it. Fix himself, fix her, fix them. Deep down he knew he couldn't, but his hope and her blame kept him tied there.  He'd tried counselors. He went alone when she'd refused to go. And when she insisted that he stop, that the counselor was driving them apart, he'd stopped.

He'd found a perfect job, working at one of the few private libraries remaining in Baltimore. He'd only get one or two customers a day and they were usually older; if anything, Ben found himself getting along better with them than people his own age; the elderly clients seemed to talk and move at the pace he was accustomed to these days.\n\nHe settled in well to his new life; he was more lonely than he had been, but that suited him well. He had a new companion, in the form of a stray he named Tipsy, that had wandered up to his feet when he was getting back to his apartment one night. She only had three paws and occasionally fell over, but they were fast friends.\n\nAll in all, his life was stable, boring; an easy sort of anguish. And every day, as he left the library, sometimes with Tipsy peeking out of his backpack along with a few children's books; the short ones with the easier words, he would take the 57 bus and transfer to the 23 to get to the long term care facility. There he would take the elevator to the fourth floor, his legs a bit too weak for the stairs, and sit next to Jess, who was perpetually silent except for the occasional hiss and beep of the ventilator, and read to her. Often, he would fall asleep in the chair next to her, dreaming that perhaps tomorrow would be his lucky day, and he would get to talk to her again.   \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo all of you are ridiculous, amazing people.

A hero? On a Wednesday afternoon? \n\nShe snapped her fingers.\n\n\"I'm here to- *urp!*\"\n\nUltraman paused in his story. \"Did you say something, Rime?\"\n\nRime gave him an apologetic smile. \"It wasn't me. I think it's from outside. I'll just pop out to see what it is, won't be a moment.\"\n\nShe stepped out of the study and shut the door behind her gently before leaning back on it, taking a deep breath. She could feel the familiar weight of her mask clipped to her belt. It was designed to cover her whole face with dark, jagged crystals, all harsh lines and sharp edges, black ice as twisted and as dangerous as she was supposed to be. She put it on.\n\nRime briskly made her way to the hero she'd flash frozen in a cube of ice in her hallway. She couldn't\u200b quite make out the mask underneath the murky surface, but the costume was gaudy, the colors garish. She couldn't help but sigh. An amateur, but that was only to be expected - the veterans in the United League of Heroes knew better than to disturb her on Wednesdays.\n\nShe snapped her fingers. \n\nThe cube melted in an instant, freezing water gushing across the floor, draining quietly through the numerous storm drains she'd had installed. \n\nThe hero inside it coughed, a series of violent, hacking sounds, and Rime felt her lips curl into a sneer. She'd only frozen the hero for a minute at best. Newbies nowadays...\n\n\"Rime!\" the hero called - well, wheezed. \"I'm here to-\"\n\n\"Your name?\" Rime said. \n\n\"Stop you- huh?\" the hero faltered. This close, their voice was young, high pitched, still slightly squeaky. \"My... what?\"\n\n\"Your. Name.\" Rime said, enunciating the words clearly. She gestured at the hero's bedraggled costume.\n\nThe hero blinked up at her. \"I'm- I'm Phoenix.\"\n\nRime rolled her eyes. Seriously? \"Let me guess. You had some sort of traumatic incident in your life most likely due to a supervillain, a superhero saved you, and since then your lifelong dream was to become a superhero just like them?\"\n\nPhoenix stared at her, mouth slightly open, as though halfway through objecting but not sure to what.\n\nRime waited a moment. It was only polite.\n\nWhen no response was forthcoming, she continued. \"Let's see if I'm on a lucky streak. Lo and behold, you're one of the lucky few that get usable powers, you realize you have a knack for fire, and you have the brilliant idea to come here to try to get rid of me once and for all because I'm the President of the Confederation and hence must be the worst villain around, and fire, after all, completely negates ice? Or so you'd think, at least?\"\n\n\"Uh.\" said Phoenix.\n\n\"Did you listen at all during class? They teach you this on the first week.\"\n\nThe blush was a dead giveaway.\n\nRime sighed. \"Oh, dear. You went off to find me the moment you got your powers, didn't you? Did you have the costume ready made?\"\n\nIt was disappointing. The quality of fledgling heroes kept dropping with every passing year. There were just too many heroes convinced they were experts on fighting crime after reading a how-to guide on the internet.\n\n\"So, Phoenix,\" Rime continued. \"Usually, as retribution, I'd freeze you in a block of ice and keep you that way until the League realized you're missing, but my afternoon is already fully booked. I need to deal with Ultraman's latest attempt to foil my plans. Do feel free to come back around tomorrow if you fancy being frozen again.\"\n\n\"Ultraman?!\" Phoenix exclaimed, suddenly talkative once more. \"He's like... old, and washed up, and senile! He's not even part of the League anymore!\"\n\nRime had to restrain herself from freezing Phoenix - oh, but how she hated that name - right then and there. \"He's also been fighting crime for more than fifty years,\" she said coldly, \"Which you would know if you actually went to class. And when the League decided he wasn't useful to them anymore, they discharged him without so much as a pension or even a thank you. Fifty years and it meant nothing to them. The League isn't government funded. It runs for profit, and at the end of the day, it cares about money. The League didn't much fancy taking care of an elderly, senile hero... so it let him go.\"\n\nPhoenix gaped at her. It only lasted for a moment. \"The League would never do something like that!\"\n\n\"Ask the League where Ultraman's pension is,\" Rime said. \"Or Wonderlady's, or Crowstorm's, or any of the older heroes for that matter. The League doesn't care. But we at the Confederation remember, and we at the Confederation care - we have a caretaker rotation. The enemy of my enemy and all that, as they say, because the League most certainly hasn't been friendly in its dealings with its older heroes. One might even say it's been quite villainous.\"\n\n\"You're lying!\" Phoenix cried out. \"The League wouldn't do that, and you're just saying it because you're, you're a villain! And evil!\"\n\nRime had lost what little patience she had left for that conversation. \"If that helps you sleep at night, then by all means keep telling yourself that. Just remember to ask yourself why none of the League veterans ever come to challenge me on a Wednesday. Now get out of my lair before I decide I do actually have enough time to freeze you.\"\n\nA wave of her hand sent a barricade of ice slamming up from the floor, a wall of jagged frost that blocked Phoenix from her sight. \n\nRime stepped back into the study a few minutes later. \"Sorry, Ultraman. That took a little longer than I expected...\" she trailed off, finding Ultraman asleep in his armchair.\n\n\"Huh?\" Ultraman grunted, rousing himself. \"Whassat?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Rime said. \"Sorry for waking you.\"\n\n\"You younglings nowadays, and your nothing.\" Ultraman grumbled. \"It's always nothing with you. Back in my day, we didn't sit around doing nothing, we found ourselves something to do.\"\n\nRime smiled, turning away to hide it. \"I'm sure you did,\" she said. \"I'm sure you did.\"\n\n\"You kids nowadays have it so easy, sitting around all day.

A red square was emblazoned on the front, with the yellow image of a hammer and sickle right in the center. Years of sand-blasting storms had taken their toll, chipping away at the edges of the paint until it was jagged and faded. Only the slightest outline of the letters \"CCCP\" were still visible.\n\n\u201cDefinitely Russian,\u201d Commander Davis radioed back to the Mars habitat facility. \u201cSoviet Era.\u201d That had been the working theory ever since the door had been identified in one of the rover\u2019s photos, but no one had been sure until now. The Russians had steadfastly denied that they\u2019d made it to Mars, much less that they\u2019d established some sort of colony. But who else could it have been? Who else had a secretive space program?\n\nThe hatch was locked, of course. \u201cShould we knock?\u201d Rodriguez joked. Commander Davis gave the door a hearty pound, but no one answered. Their drill, originally built to excavate soil samples, wasn\u2019t exactly equipped to cut through solid steel. Instead, they bore holes through the red rocks around the hinges until it crumbled apart and the door came crashing down. The airlock was dark and silent. \n\nDavis and the crew entered the facility. The winding hallway descended deep under the mountain. They passed by room after room, full of bunk beds for sleeping and a large cafeteria with neatly stacked trays. Some of them held computers larger than the rover they\u2019d driven over here. There was an entire floor of greenhouses, now just full of withered stalks and brown soil. \n\n\u201cWhat do you think happened here?\u201d Hatfield asked, shining his flashlight on a teddy bear that had been abandoned in the hallway.\n\nFinally, the expedition found the colony's inhabitants in some sort of large gathering space, like an auditorium. The door was sealed from the outside, with no escape. Through a thick window covered in scratch marks, Commander Davis could see decaying bodies in red jump suits. Some were holding others in one last embrace. Others were apparently trying to escape through some sort of vent, with little luck. \n\n\u201cCommander?\u201d Norvolisk, the only member of the crew who could read Cyrillic, trained his flashlight beam on a sign. \u201cThis hallway leads to the General\u2019s office, it says.\u201d \n\nThis door also had a lock, strong enough to be a bank vault. But it was open. There was a single body at the desk with a pistol in hand and a hole through the forehead. Also on the desk were a stack of journals, each marked with dates ranging from 1963 to 2002.\n\n\u201cDay 1,\u201d Norvolisk read aloud. \u201cThe Soviet Republic of Mars is hereby established with the purpose of keeping the People\u2019s Revolution alive even in the event of catastrophic war on Earth. Should the Americans learn of this installation, we would most certainly be a target for attack, and cannot live on the surface in plain view. Therefore, my crew of two hundred is busy hollowing out this living space\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cHow in the hell could they establish an off-world colony without us knowing?\u201d \n\nThe journal that Norvolisk was reading started listing off what supplies they\u2019d brought with them, which (while interesting) was really not the question on everyone\u2019s mind right now. He dropped that and picked up the most recent one, last dated March 21, 2002. \n\n\u201cAfter 12 years since the last reply from Earth,\u201d the final entry read, \u201cI am forced to conclude the worst: there has been a nuclear war, and our comrades are destroyed. The replacement parts for the water recycler will never arrive. Even this failsafe colony will not be enough to keep the human race alive. Instead, we will all die of dehydration. Faced with that consequence, I had no choice but to exercise Protocol 92 and terminate the colony in a quick and relatively painless way. The gas was deployed at approximately 16:00. Their screams\u2026\u201d There was a tremor in Norvolisk\u2019s voice as he read the entry. The page was spattered with small flecks of blood. \u201cTheir screams will haunt me even after I take my own life.

Eighty years had passed by in a blink of an eye. When I had been Sherry\u2019s age, I had thought myself invincible.

Because if there was ever a scene to immortalize, to be my last, it would be this. Sherry, her bright green eyes glistening with tears, my children and grandchildren all around me as the heart beat monitor lulled me to a gentle and permanent sleep.\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d I told them all and I closed my eyes.\n\nMy eyes opened.\n\n\u201cHow was the trip?\u201d a familiar voice asked from beside me.\n\nI looked around at the purple moss smothering the rolling hills and the campfire burning in front of me.

My name had never been Terry, it was Zor\u2019oah.\n\n\u201cYo, dude, you back with us?\u201d Galmroh said, snapping purple fingers in front of my face.\n\nI coughed and nodded. Seventeen eyes looked at me from the six people sitting around the campfire. Just as I had wished as fifty-year old Terry, I had gotten my time back. Zor\u2019oah was a freshman in high school who finally got invited by the popular kids into a drug-fueled camping adventure. Three boys, three girls, and a lot of \u201c*you can\u2019t blame me for that, I was high*\u201d.\n\nGalmroh and Sardak had already paired up, leaving me with Sierrah, the reason I had agreed to come.

Tell us all the things you did,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cBet you can\u2019t beat me,\u201d Galmroh said, his chest inflating with pride. \u201cMy first trip, I enslaved an entire race and forced them to build these stupid triangles.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least he can\u2019t do as bad as Sardak\u2019s first trip. He was just a slave. At least he killed someone before his trip ended.\u201d Sierrah said.\n\nThey turned to me again, waiting to hear of all my misdeeds. \u201cI was a man named Terry,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd um\u2026 I met this girl named Sarah.\u201d\n\nSierrah\u2019s smile grew. \u201cSarah, eh? Tell us, what nasty things did you do to this *Sarah*?\u201d\n\nBlood rushed to my face, burning it a deep violet. \u201cI married her,\u201d I said.\n\nGalmroh choked on a breath. Sardak burst out laughing. The rest of the girls only furrowed their brows.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I knew I should stop. I had spent an entire semester trying to join this circle and continuing the Life of Terry was social suicide. But someone had to know of that first kiss with Sarah, the look in her eye staring at our first child together, and the tears in Sherry\u2019s eyes when she told me her final goodbye.\n\nSo I told them, my voice tinged with pride. At the end of my story, I was the only one smiling and my smile stretched from cheek to cheek.\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d Galmroh said, awe in his voice. \u201cThat was\u2026 super lame.\u201d\n\nEverybody burst into collective laughter.\n\n\u201cYou did even worse than me on my first trip!\u201d Sardak howled. \u201cYou\u2019re such a wimp!

I opened the hatch of my spaceship and was just about to get in when I heard, \u201cZor\u2019oah!\u201d\n\nI turned to find Sierrah. She hunched over, panting, one of the buttons on her blouse undone. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to run.

Though they may never fully quell War's influence, they made sure he would never afflict the world so spectacularly ever again.\n\nDeath was unhappy. Mankind had defeated his brothers and impeded his work. In his impatience and anger, he consulted his 5th brother, Kyle.\n\nKyle was a strange fellow amongst the brothers. He was quiet, lazy and seemed to care little for Death's work. He decided that his own birthname was too tedious to pronounce and opted for an easier name. Gaelic in origin, \"Kyle\" meant \"narrow\" a strange name for a Horseman to take on.\n\n\"Help me Kyle. My brothers are defeated. Mankind may one day defeat me as well. Please help out just this once.\" Kyle said nothing and merely nodded. He then disappeared off to perform his work.\n\nAs Death sat around his bedridden brothers, a miracle occured. Pestilence finger twitched and he his hands grew fleshy. Disease once again spread around the world. No longer as powerful as he once was, but alive once again.\n\nFamine groaned and began to sit upright. Once again, crops wilted and people starved. Famine however, felt something amiss, some of his work was...voluntary. Mankind began to starve itself.\n\nWar rose from his bed with new found strength. The gears of conflict shook off their rust and began to turn once again. Innocents die in battle again, widows gained and fathers lost. Misguided soldiers die under authority's whims.\n\n\"You revived our brothers Kyle. How did you do it?\" Asked Death, impressed with Kyle's work.\n\n\"I am Kyle, \"narrow\", the fourth of the Horsemen. Born with humanity but before War. My influence appeared when the first man decided that he did not need his tribe to survive. Narrow are the minds of humans.\n\nHumans defeated disease with miracle cures. Now some fear that those cures are harmful to them. Let them face Pestilence's wrath.\n\nHumans defeated Famine through piling resources and modifying crop. Now they hoard but never give. They let their breathren starve. Now they feel that excess of food is sin. They willing starve themselves of their source of strength to meet society's whims. Let them suffer by Famine's hand.\n\nHumans defeated War through tolerance, diplomacy and restraint. Now they turn intolerant and unleash violence against those not of their own group. They justify their \"Holy Wars\" with the blood of innocents. Violence begets violence, vengeance for innocent blood spilled is carried out by the sword. Let them spiral down to oblivion, guided by War.\n\nNarrow are the minds of humans. They do not think before they act. They believe what they want to believe and ignore what they don't. \n\nI am Ignorance. Until mankind is capable of defeating me, they can never truly destroy the Horsemen.\"\n\n\n\nEDIT: Nice to receive some criticism, turns out I severely lack knowledge on how the whole 4 Horsemen thing works. I really should go read up on this. Some mistakes here and there as well. I kinda, forgot to follow up on the \"modified crop\" thing that was pointed out. Oops. Also apparently my 5th paragraph should have Death refer to Kyle as his 4th brother, not his 5th.\n\nReddit gold. Did not expect that. Thanks to those who tossed those my way.

We were standing in front of the bathtub, feeling a bit foolish. Well, I was at least. I knew this was all a joke, but for some reason my heart was was hammering like a drum. \u201cClose your eyes babe,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cI don't want to miss anything. This whole dimension jumping is not exactly something one does every day, after all.\u201d I could see a spider crawling it's way across the bottom of the tub, a dark speck in a sea of cream, zig-zagging its way towards the drain.\n\n\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d \n\nI looked at my husband. \u201cWould I be standing in a bathroom like this if I didn't?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou're humoring me. I get it. But I'm not lying.\u201d One lock of my hair fell out of my tight bun of hair and hung loosely in front of my face. Malcolm reached out and brushed it out of the way so that he could stare me in the face. \u201cHey, I love you. Now close your eyes.\u201d\n\nI took a deep breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nHe clasped my hand again, and I squeezed it until the knuckles turned white. I felt him slip a small piece of paper into my palm. I looked up at him quizzically, but he was already facing forward at the wall. \u201cOn the count of three, then we'll do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\nHe ignored me. \u201cOne. Two. *Three!*\u201d\n\nI shut my eyes and felt a sharp jerk on my hand, and then my navel, and then suddenly the floor was gone and  I was flying. I could feel wind and particles whipping by my face. I wanted to scream, but was afraid if I opened my mouth then something might fly in it. \n\nThere was a second sharp pull at my arm wrenching my sharply in a new angle, and I was thrust away from my husband. I lost all reservations and opened my mouth to scream his name, but nothing came out, the sound of my voice consumed by the void of another dimension. Then I was alone.\n\nMy body connected with something hard, and I lost consciousness.\n\n\n*** \n\nSeagulls.\n\nI could hear them calling to each other.\n\nIt had been ages since Malcolm and I had taken a proper vacation to the ocean. It was good to finally be back, except why was I at the ocean again?\n\n\u201cYou alright, miss?\u201d\n\nI opened my eyes, and only saw blurry shapes. The world was fuzzy as if I needed a pair of glasses, but I could make out three distinct colors: the dark navy water of the ocean, the bright cerulean of the sky and the beige expanse of sand stretching for miles in two directions before me. The sun was hot on my skin and sand was sticking in bunches to my elbows. I waited patiently for my mind to unscramble and my bearings to return to me.\n\nIt came in pieces: Followed Malcolm into bathroom. Different dimension. New life. Flying. Got separated. Hit a thing. Here now.\n\n\u201cHello? Miss? You a mute or somethin'?\u201d\n\nI looked up. A girl no older then twelve or thirteen was looking down at me. She had tanned skin and short sandy hair fashioned in a pixie cut. She was offering a hand to me, and it was at that moment that I realized that I was sprawled out on my back.\n\n\u201cI'm okay...I think. Thanks.\u201d I accepted her hand and let her pull me to my feet. My entire body ached, as if I had done a work out at the gym for the first time in months. The girl was strong for her size, and did all the work to get me standing again.\n\nI began to dust sand out of my plaid pajama bottoms. I noticed the girl was staring at me with a  funny look. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, still groggy.\n\n\u201cThat's a funny thing you wearin'. You're from the Outside, yeah?\u201d\n\n*If the Outside is a different dimension, then yeah,* I thought.\n\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d I looked around. Out past a horizon of dunes, I could see a row of thatched, red roofs, a patchwork plain of mismatched and uneven tiles. It appeared to be some type of shanty fishing town. There were fishing lines dotting the shoreline, propped up in the sand, all facing the sea.\n\n\u201cYou must have come for the funeral then. Lot's of Outsiders will be sailing in the next few days. Guess you must have shipwrecked huh?\u201d\n\nMy head was still pounding and I only understood half of what the girl was saying. \u201cFuneral? No. I'm looking for a man. Name is Malcolm Reynolds. Apparently he's lived...uh...here for about 1000 years. You heard of him?\u201d\n\nThe girl shook her head and kicked at the sand. \u201cDon't know anyone by that name. It's a big world miss.\u201d She took a step closer and peered a bit closer in to my hears. \u201cWe should get you to a doctor. We only got herbalists in the fishing village, so if you want a real one you have to head into the city.\u201d\n\nI shook my head. \u201cI can do that later, after I find my husband.\u201d\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cSuit yourself. You said he lived here a thousand years, yeah? Well anyone that lives that long would have to have a record in the city library.\u201d She began to walk over to the fishing lines by the sea to check them. \u201cI'm heading up that way for the funeral, you can join me if you like.\u201d\n\nIt wasn't like I had any better ideas. I looked in both directions as far as I could, craning my neck as I did so. No sign of Malcolm anywhere. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. I held out my hand again. \u201cI'm Jill, by the way.\u201d\n\nShe clasped in with bony fingers. \u201cPleasure to meet you, Ms. Jill the Outsider. I'm Ko'sa.\u201d She pointed back towards the village. \u201cLet's head back to my cottage. We can stop and get provisions before we head into the capital. If we leave now we can get in before the lines at the city gates get too long.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cMust be quite a funeral.\"\n\n\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Ko'sa grinned. \u201cIt's a funeral for the queen, after all.\u201d\n\n*The queen? Guess even alternate dimensions are ruled by royalty,*  I thought.\n\n\u201cShe was a good queen then?\u201d\n\nKo'sa bowed her head. \u201cYeah. She'll be missed, at least by most of us. Some of us... wonder about her death. Whether it was really natural or not. The Queen and the King were an arranged marriage you see, didn't exactly fancy each other. Some say he had it in for her, loved another.\u201d\n\nAs Ko'sa prattled on about the royal family, I realized there was something pressed against my left palm, now slick with sweat. I opened my hand to reveal a note. The same note that Malcolm had thrust into my hand back in the bathroom. \n\nIt was tiny and rolled up neatly, like a scroll. With fingers that were slightly trembling, I unrolled the tiny piece of parchment and read the words in my husband's hand writing.\n\n> If you ever need to find me, just ask for the King ;)\n\n\n***\n\n/r/ghost_write_the_whip"}, {"author": "Luna_LoveWell", "score": 8031, "prompt": " Star Wars is a true story.

He moved away from dryer and heard the noise as people shuffled to the ground.  \n\nThe restrooms were situated down a small hallway, which allowed Joe to move quietly down the hall to survey what had gone on.  He saw men, women and children on the ground, and guys in masks already walking past the hallway, and toward the front counter.  \n\nSomething bumped into his stomach, and he took a chance to look down... only to find a young girl, no more than 10 or 11, huddled next to a potted plant that was situated in the hallway.  She was hiding.  No one had seen her.  Joe breathed a sigh of both relief, and profound irritation.  \n\nHe slid down next to her, and they exchanged glances.  She looked terrified.  He stared, and smiled in what he hoped was a fatherly-way.  \n\n\"Psst, kid... What's your name?\"  \n\nThe girl looked him over, trying to decide if he was a stranger, or not.

And pulled out a snickers bar.  \n\nHer eyes opened, amazed.  Her pupils were slightly dilated.  She looked at Joe and smiled at him.  \"Wow!

Another had seen Joe, and pointed his gun at him.  \n\n\"You two!  Get back on the ground.\"  \n\n\"Katy, get down!  You're going to get hurt!\" he could hear a person saying.

I can do anything!\"  And her eyes were suddenly flaring up with flame, and her hands were engulfed in ice, and water, and lightning.  And a sudden storm *inside the bank* brought the robbers to their knees.  They were struck with lightning, and were down for the count.  \n\nJoe smiled as he walked toward them, kicking their guns away.  He had plastic cuffs for just such an occasion, and locked them up.  \n\nKaty's eyes returned to normal, and she smiled.  \"I did it!  I believed I had powers over the elements!  And I really couldn't be hurt!\"  The father had jumped up and was holding Katy, now.  Joe smiled.  \n\nHe turned, then, and left the bank as quietly as possible.  A new super, born in the world.

It was best to keep prophecy-spewing maidens close to the den, after all. So when the aforementioned oracle made the \"Great Prophecy\" that foretold of his reign's end by the hand of a farm girl, the Dark One was the first to hear of it.\n\nIn response, he did the logical thing. He marched over to the squalid hut that the baby lived in, gave the parents enough money to be comfortable, and kept his second-best regiment posted by their newly-furnished house. After all, the Dark One assured the parents, their child was destined for great things. You could never be too careful. There were plenty of people who'd want to take advantage of a gifted child.\n\nLook, he might have gotten the title of \"Dark One\" thanks to his mastery of black magic, but he wasn't evil. Unlike what those rebellious bands of terrorists thought, he had a reason for everything he did. It rankled a bit to rule over the realms with an iron fist, but *come on.* Until the populace was educated and advanced enough to govern itself, the people had to be united by force. The centuries of civil war before him just proved his point.\n\nSpeaking of education, he also ensured that Little Miss Chosen One had access to the best teachers. Dammit, if he was going to be overthrown by someone (though he was still holding out on that), it better be by someone smart\u2014not some lunk with a sword. Of course, the drooler extraordinaire seemed more interested in slobbering over the books than reading them.\n\nOnce the kid actually learned how to read, however, that changed. The Dark One would visit her in between crushing insurrections with a new bundle of books in hand. She had an insatiable curiosity, devouring books faster than he could throw them at her. Her parents, though good people, didn't know the answers to anything. And though her tutors were the best, their knowledge paled in comparison to the master himself.... which is why he got the short end of the stick. \n\n\"Uncle Dark,\" she'd chirp, persisting in calling him by that stupid name, \"why can't we make more magic? Why do the elves and orcs hate each other? Why are there two suns?\" Why, why, *why.* If he never heard that phrase again, he'd die happy. If he ever died, that was. However, the Dark One had to admit that there was something satisfying about teaching someone and watching them thrive. He wondered why he hadn't done it sooner, honestly. (Oh, right. Students tended to overthrow their teachers to an alarming degree.)\n\nThe years seemed to pass faster than usual. He visited the girl, developed the economy, killed copycat \"Chosen Ones,\" vanquished chaos demons, and before he knew it, the child was no longer a child. Her knowledge began to outpace that of the tutors he sent, and soon, she was a skilled mage in her own right\u2014a fully-developed *person*, too. With his immortality, the Dark One had forgotten how quickly mortals grew. He could forget no longer, though. \n\n\"Did you do it?\" she asked, standing as tall as his physical body. \"Did you massacre all those Reedlings?\"\n\nThe Dark One paused in his eightieth reread of *The Elements of Magic.* He remembered the massacre very well. It was what had given him his name. The Reedlings had kept rebelling and rebelling, and he'd just cast the immortality spell so his control had been unstable, and... he could think of a thousand excuses, but that wasn't what she'd asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said instead. \"I did.\"\n\n\"Why?\" The Dark One could hear the echo of her childish squeak, but the steel in her voice was anything but. \n \n\"I have never lied to you. I will not start now.\" And so, he began to talk. He started at the very beginning, back when he was still a mortal child in a different world. He talked about his discovery by a master wizard, his accidental use of the dimensional-portal spell, his rise to power... and everything in between. For the first time, he explained everything\u2014what he did, how he did it, and most importantly, *why.*\n\nThe sun had set by the time he'd finished. The Chosen One was silent for what felt like too long.\n\n\"I understand,\" she said finally. \"What you did wasn't right, but I understand.\"\n\nA weight had been lifted from his shoulders, and the Dark One knew that he'd done something right. \"I think you should join the rebellion.\"\n\n\"What?\" She stared at him. \"You want me to join a disparate, silly gaggle of terrorists that want to kill you?\"\n\n\"That's what they are right now. But with you at the helm, they'll be a force to reckon with.\"\n\nIt took her quite some time to agree, but the Chosen One wasn't stupid. He'd made sure of that. She understood what he was asking, and so, she set off to fulfill her end of the prophecy. On his part, the Dark One encouraged rumors of the Chosen One's rise. He'd already loosened his grip over the empire in the last few decades, and it mostly functioned without his direct intervention, leaving him as just a figurehead. Everything was in place. All he had to do was wait. \n\nYears later, the Chosen One faced him again. The ragtag band of rebels had become a united force, and she led them as an accomplished mage and skilled tactician. They exchanged a show of magic for the masses before the Dark One allowed himself to be cornered inside his own castle. Everyone else was kept out by the barriers.\n\n\"This realm is ready for you,\" he said, sitting at the foot of his throne. \"The economy about to industrialize, the populace is educated, and best of all, everyone is united in their hatred of me.\"\n\n\"You really did plan this all, didn't you?\" The Chosen One laughed before taking her seat beside him. \"I've always been in awe of your foresight, but one question has bothered me through all these years: why did you do it?\" She paused and continued in a much softer tone. \"And why me?\"\n\nHe smiled. \"During my long life, I've learned that prophecies come true whether you like them or not. I hate them on principle, of course. They're too deterministic for my taste, but even prophecies let you choose how they come true. If my reign has to end, then I'd rather it be by someone who knows what they're doing. Someone like you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that\u2014\"\n\n\"Don't be. I've been needing a break. Besides, I haven't visited the other worlds in a long, long time. One of them probably needs an evil overlord to overthrow, right?\"\n\nShe wiped away her tears and gave him a watery smile. \"I'll make you proud, Uncle Dark.\"\n\nThe Dark One patted her head, and as he disintegrated into dust, he said, \"You already have.\""}, {"author": "Luna_LoveWell", "score": 7700, "prompt": " You obtain a device that tells you exactly what choices to make in order to lead the \"happiest\" life possible.

No big deal*.\n\n\"You know what,\" I wrote back, practically pounding on the ancient beige keyboard, \"That's it. That's it, Oracle. I'm done with this whole thing. I quit.\" My hands shook as I wrote it, and my heart was hammering against my ribs. I'd wanted to do it for so long, but I just never could work up the courage to let go. \n\nOracle had guided me through life since I first got the computer in the 80s. Some kid at Radio Shack told me it would give me good life advice and sold it to me on a floppy disk for two dollars, and I've never been one to pass up a good deal. I figured that at worst, it was just some piece of junk that wouldn't really do anything. This was before viruses and malware were really a thing. So I popped in the disk, and it told me that I should start brushing my teeth twice a day instead of just once. \n\nEvery day, it was a new piece of advice. Just little things to begin with, like changing up my hairstyle or whatever, but it eventually gained my trust and started meddling more and more with my life. It gave me business advice, stock tips, real estate intelligence, and relationship advice that was always sound. Years later, I've got more money than I ever thought I could make, and I've got a beautiful family. A gorgeous wife, five wonderful children, a great job that I really enjoy... I've got everything. Fame and fortune, with none of the drug problems and mental breakdowns that usually seem to go along with those two. And yet the Oracle kept pushing. It told me that my life could always get better. That it knew exactly what to do. And so I listened. I followed along blindly, and it's led down a dark path to this. \n\nOracle has made me do terrible things. I've destroyed people's careers, I've humiliated people, said horrible, nasty things that I really didn't mean... but this? Threatening to *kill* someone's family? \n\n> If you leave now, it will all be wasted.\n\nThe words flashed on Oracle's screen in dull green. There should be a name for that greenish color from before computer monitors could actually display real colors. I'd call it \"80's green.\"\n\n> Everything that you've built will crumble. You know that I am right. And you can make the **world** a better place if you just follow my orders. I've never let you down before. \n\nI should have just left right then and there. I could have stood up from the chair and walked out of the room and never looked at Oracle again. Just spent the rest of my life lounging on a sunny beach in Florida or something. But I didn't. I hesitated.\n\nThat night, I got up on stage and took the mic in front of thousands of cheering fans. \"And we're not just going to hunt down those terrorist bastards in ISIS,\" I shouted. \"We're gonna go after their families, too!\" My stomach churned just uttering the words: I was suggesting a *war crime* like it was a good thing! But of course, the crowds ate it up. Hell, they'd applaud for anything I did nowadays. I could probably shoot someone on 5th avenue and they'd cheer. Once the thunderous wave of clapping died down, I spoke into the mic again. \"Thank you, Iowa! Let's make America great again!\"\n\n----\n\nI hope you enjoyed it!

He stepped back from the entrance to the carriage--and into the path of a wheeled trolley burdened with a trunk, cauldron, and books wrapped in brown paper and twine. An owl, snowy white, familiar amber eyes, rested in a birdcage atop of the ordered chaos.\n\n\"Ooh! I'm sorry,\" squeaked the young girl behind the trolley.\n\n\"Not your fault,\" Harry said with an easy smile. \"First year?\"\n\nThe girl nodded, unable to suppress an excited grin of her own. She beamed from ear to ear, all four feet and change, under a crop of frizzy blonde hair. Harry had seen his own kids, Lily only a year older, look this young, but couldn't imagine himself ever being so small. In the years since the war, the wizarding population in Britain had blossomed. Hogwarts, home to only hundreds of students during Harry's years there, now housed thousands. The castle grew as needed.\n\n\"Petunia,\" a low voice said through a cloud of loose steam. \"Mind that trolley, now. I--\"\n\nA tall man emerged through the cloud, a gentle hand coming to rest on the young girl's--Petunia's--shoulder. Harry and the man met each other's eyes and twenty years fell away in moments. \n\nHe had shed most of his weight, or grown into it, Harry thought, though vestiges of heavy jowls, a gut plumped by one too many beers, was noticeable under his simple pinstriped suit. His blonde hair had receded, a crown he kept cut short, and there was something different in his eyes. Something kind, gentle.\n\n\"Hello, Dudley,\" Harry said.\n\n\"Harry,\" Dudley said carefully, giving him a polite nod. \"I... I never thought we'd actually bump into you.\"\n\n\"Who's he, dad?\" little Petunia asked.\n\nDudley swallowed. He gazed at Harry, perhaps trying to read the calm look on his face, as crowds of people parted around them. Laughter and excitement faded to uncertainty. \n\n\"An old fr...\" Dudley shook his head. \"This is my cousin, Petunia. Harry Potter.\"\n\nPetunia marched around the back of her trolley and stuck her hand out. \"Nice to meet you, Harry Pot--\" Her sparkling blue eyes widened. \"I read about you! You're in *The Fall of the Dark Lord* by Hermione Granger.\"\n\nA smile touched Harry's face, but not his eyes. He took Petunia's hand and shook once, politely.\n\n\"Been a long time,\" he said to Dudley. \"Never thought I'd see you on this platform, though stranger things have happened and all that.\" Dudley nodded once. A long silence stretched toward uncomfortable. \"How are your parents?\"\n\nDudley cleared his throat and glanced sideways at Petunia. \"We don't... we haven't really spoken so much in the last few years. They knew Petunia was...\" He grit his teeth and forced a smile. \"You can imagine.\"\n\n\"All too well,\" Harry said, and that was enough. He'd learnt long ago not to let the past hurt.\n\n\"I want to get on the train, dad!\" Petunia said, bouncing on the spot, foot to foot, eager and excited.\n\nDudley nodded. \"Go see your mother. She's talking to the conductor down there, and get your belongings loaded onto the train. I'll be along shortly.\"\n\n\"Where do the first-years go?\" she asked. \"Do you know, Mr Potter?\"\n\nDudley looked uncertain. Harry knelt down on his haunches till he was eye level with the little girl. \"Anywhere they like,\" he said. \"It's a big train, plenty of room, and lots of snacks to be had on the trip up. But if you do feel lost, look for a girl named Lily. She'll help you find the right compartment.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Petunia asked.\n\nHarry nodded most seriously. \"Lily is your second cousin. Family look out for each other.\"\n\nPetunia mulled that over and then took her trolley off down the platform with a massive grin. Harry stood and met Dudley's unsure, guilty look.\n\n\"Family look out for each other,\" Dudley said, his words hollow, almost gaunt.\n\nHarry crossed his arms over his chest. \"I don't blame you for what happened when we were kids, Dudley. We were just that, you know. Kids.\"\n\n\"What my parents did to you...\"\n\nHarry raised his hand. \"Forgiven, not forgotten. But I hope to never see them again. That's all I'll say.\"\n\n\"It's different,\" Dudley began and gave a nervous chuckle. \"When it's your kid, it's different. I'm so proud of her, Harry. For being special. For being... well, her.\"\n\nHarry could understand that. He had three of his own, with plans for a fourth. The wizarding world needed more children, more life and light.\n\n\"Is it safe for her?\" Dudley asked. \"...Hogwarts?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"I've spent my life making sure of that.\"\n\n\"Thank you for pointing Petunia in Lily's direction. I worry she'll be a bit behind the others.\"\n\nHarry chuckled softly and clapped his cousin on the arm. \"The owl - that was your idea?\"\n\n\"Mary thought I was mad,\" Dudley said. \"That's my wife. She's normal--I mean, non-magical. Sorry. When I told her I knew some of this world,\" he waved around at the train, the platform, the blue in the sky, \"she almost went to stay at her mother's. It's a hard thing, keeping this secret.\"\n\nHarry thought about that, memories of his time at Privet Drive flashing through his mind. Memories of long ago, and so much worse, the dark years, the struggle after the war. \"I'll get Lily to speak to your daughter,\" he said. \"We can exchange a few owls, if you like. Any questions you might have.\"\n\nDudley stared at Harry for a long moment. \"You'd do that? After... well, everything?\" He looked flabbergasted. \"I don't know if I'd be so kind, if the roles were reversed.\"\n\n\"I've seen what can happen to someone who dwells on unkindness, and anger.

The coffee shop was quiet, as always. People held quiet 'nonversations,' pointing and grunting as much as possible to express their thoughts. A man walked up to the counter and pointed at the menu that was on the counter. The cashier's gaze followed his finger to the menu item, and she hit a few buttons on the register. A price displayed, the man paid it. The cashier smiled at him and gave him a grateful \"ghn\" of appreciation. Not a word. The man just returned the smile and nodded. \n\nThey said the written language was originally invented to try to bypass the Final Tally, the word count that governed our lives. Hadn't worked - if it was a word, you got a tick. So computers did much of the writing, generating based on algorithms, and providing lists for people to point at. So long as you weren't too precise in your pointing, you didn't use your words. \n\n\nOf course, that was neither here nor there. The important part of that particular order was the man making it was my target. Jimmy, his name was. Jimmy was one of the longest living people ever - he only had one word left, then he would die. Normally that would make him an oddity, but Jimmy knew something. A word that could completely destroy my employers if he ever said it.\n\nI didn't know what it was. Didn't care. Wasn't my job to care. It was my job to get Jimmy to say that last word, so he could move on to the next life. I still have over 500,000 words left. Plenty of time for me. \n\nHe'd be a tough nut to crack, though. Had hit his second to last word 10 years ago, and then had gone silent. Lots of attempts had been made ot get Jimmy to talk, but no one had managed it before. Then again, I hadn't tried yet.\n\nIt wasn't illegal, what I did, not really. Not unless I used physical force to get them to talk, or some other otherwise inhumane mean, and I pride myself on being humane. Clean.

Had been an actor in the \"grunties,\" a master of conveying emotion and thought without words. He'd occasionally, even before he got to his last one, go months without talking, just to prove that he could. \n\nBut I know his secret. \n\n315 years is a long time. Longer than anyone should have a right to live. And there's no one, and I mean no one, who was able to do one job for 315 years.\n\nI pulled out my phone and disabled autotype, emotitype, and autocorrect, all of which helped keep word count down. I had gotten Jimmy's number a little while back, but needed line of sight to be sure, to confirm the kill. I sent a quick text. \"Your Jimmy, right?\"\n\nHe pulled his phone out when it buzzed, and quickly shot me a thumbs up emoticon to confirm it. I waited for a moment. He looked back at his phone. I sent another text. \"Awesome. Your the best.\" He looked at the phone again, and sent another thumbs up, and a clapping face. Appreciation. He was sweating a bit. He looked back at his phone.\n\nSee, the really old, they got stuck in their ways. Almost a compulsion really. Jimmy typed something on his phone. He stopped, not hitting send yet. I waited.

Just need that last push. \"Your in town this week?\"\n\nHe shuddered as he saw the text, and without thinking, reflex two centuries old, clicked in. He hit send. And then he fell onto the table, dead. A woman screamed, and I stood up and walked out.\n\nMy phone buzzed. I knew what it would say. See, Jimmy had been an English teacher, long before he was in the grunties. And some habits? No man could break.\n\nI checked to confirm. One message. From Jimmy.

They expected I'd be here for a long time. The cell I sleep in exits into a rectangular room, exercise equipment gathered in the center and a running track around the perimeter. At one end is the kitchen with a hydroponic farm and breeding pen for what sustenance I require. Food is the hardest thing to deal with now. The other end is a library, stocked at my request.

Goodness these mortals do love to talk don't they.\n\n\"Perhaps you can release me? I'll be eternally grateful.\"\n\nI chuckle at my own joke. One must become one's own entertainment I suppose. They don't speak for a long time. So long I begin to think they won't help me.\n\n\"I'm afraid we can't.\"\n\n\"Please,\" I say, hearing the begging tone slip into my voice, \"please, it's been a very long time.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThen the *click* again and the movements stop. I am ashamed to admit that I dropped to the floor and began to weep.\n\nAfter recovering from my shameful display of emotion I found myself sitting in the library but unable to focus. There were mortals alive out there, that was something. Perhaps in a few more cycles they would release me. Surely, just a few more.\n\nAs I sit I hear something. This is different. Something I haven't heard in a very, very long time. The main door unlocking. I hear the *hiss* of the door opening and quickly make my way to the main room.\n\nA young man stands there and looks at me, nervously. He holds up both hands in a sort of mock surrender.\n\n\"I just...I don't think it's right to leave you here.\"\n\nI take a few great strides to him and he flinches but I simply wrap my arms around him and squeeze.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I whisper in his ear, tears filling my eyes, \"thank you.\"\n\nI release him and we exit the room together, hopefully for the last time. As I take my first step I am struck by several barbed objects that sink deep and then my body convulses. My muscles tighten and my jaw clamps shut and I collapse to the floor. A dozen men quickly converge and chain me with the restraints that must have been left in the guard room.\n\nOne of them, a burly man with a shaved head, stares down at me.\n\n\"Immortal, they said,\" he says it with a sneer, \"thousands of years down here? Immortal. Well we'll see.\"\n\nThen a thick rubber boot tread fills my view and it is the last thing I see before it is dark.\n\n\n*****\n\nI wake, slowly. I slowly swing my legs off the low, thin bed and rest my bare feet on the cold tiled floor. I try to stand but my legs refuse the call to action. So I sit.\n\nThe long scars that run down my leg remind me where they drew their fill of marrow from, bone marrow for their studies. I remember screaming as they cut into me, screaming for them to release me and threatening to burn their world to ash and finally pleading for them to cease.\n\nNone of that worked.\n\nI remember his laughter as I faded in and out.\n\n\"Some god,\" he said at least once, \"some immortal.\"\n\nI wanted to explain that immortal does not mean invincible but I don't think he would have cared. They wanted to know how to fight aging and disease more than they cared about semantics.\n\n\"Hey,\" I hear the voice from the door to my cell, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nI recognize him. The one who \"released\" me from my former prison, only to bring me to another.\n\n\"You.\"\n\n\"Yeah...I get it,\" I hear the door unlock from the other side, \"I'd be pissed too.\"\n\nThe door unlocks and he stands before me, sheepish.\n\n\"It's not right, I'm sorry.\"\n\nI find the strengh to stand on shaky legs and glare at him but...here he stands before me. Apologetic and perhaps releasing me.\n\n\"Is it day?\"\n\nHe nods, with a confused look.\n\n\"Can you get me outside?\"\n\nHe nods again and leads me into the hall, devoid of guards for the moment.\n\n\"I opened one of the other cells, they're busy.\"\n\n\"Which one?\" I ask, thrilled at the prospect of one of my brothers or sisters on the loose.\n\n\"Don't know, names are all faded off the doors. What...who are you anyway?\"\n\nI don't speak but we close the gap towards a door, a door that leads to stairs. I glare at him for a moment and he shrugs in response.\n\n\"Only way up.\"\n\nI grunt and we begin the arduous trek up the stairs. Each one sends pain shooting through my battered legs. I mumble some curses but continue.\n\nWhen the door opens I feel it. The warmth of the sun. I take a deep breath and stand on my own as the warmth and light do their work. The only thing I really need. I can feel lean muscles filling out, my hair turning from gray to its deep brown and the lines that crease my face disappearing. I feel...I feel like myself again.\n\nWe stand on a flat space with a large white H painted on it, overlooking a mountain range that I barely remember.\n\nHe steps away and looks at me with fear. Without the sun I was fading in that deep cell, even if I would never die of age there.

One man would walk away the greatest chess player the world had ever seen. The other would walk away, the monolith that was slain by the Goliath of the century. Both were too established to claim they were an underdog.  \n\nHiran Dutt had defeated the R09-po processor. something that many had thought was impossible. In the year 2050, chess players had been rendered obsolete when the grandmaster Cindy Stone saw the words checkmate printed on the screen. On that day it finally hit us, all of us, not just the low IQ members who washed dishes for minimum wage, it was over. Humanity had rendered itself obsolete.  \n\nthen, in 2085 something miraculous happened. A machine lost to a human. At first they thought it was a joke, but Hiran Dutt did it a second time, and a third. He was no fluke. He was the next level, the one who in spite all the processing power was always one step ahead of the machine in play.  His moves were modest, his captures so sudden, many claimed the machines were helping him. The truth was much stranger, he was a seer. Gifted with the third eye, Hiran could always see the next step the machines would take, and just like that always planned a second move ahead.  \n\nWhen machine consciousness rose a furious debate rose up in all parliaments around the world.  What were the rights of the machine? Was it base animal, our equal, or something ahead. The question was answered in installments. In the first decade it was like a baby, knowing its name, understanding stimuli and learning by downloading everything online. In its second decade it started to question its existence, it's purpose, and even its creation. In the third decade it proved way beyond. It had already made an earning as a chess player and now was going for the record of longest reigning grandmaster. \n\nHad Aiguo Bai not been born, an android would have had the record of longest reigning grandmaster, but two years short of the record he reminded it that as far as domination of humanity in sheer intelligence was concerned it was still not yet freedom.  He beat it once: in 2095. Then a second time in 2097 and a third in 2098.  He was no fluke. He was the second human to rise above the machine. Aiguo was a recluse, unbeknownst to many he could not stand the public eye because of the voices. The voices of consciousness no one else could hear. They yelled, cheered, cried and whispered the thoughts all people were too afraid to speak. He discovered the android too had a voice. It was a monotone but through it he could hear every calculation it made before making a move.      \n\nChatter broke throughout social media. Some talked of the rise of the *valde sapiens* (very wise), the next stage in evolution. Some called for them to donate their DNA for cloning we needed more to bring ourselves to the relevancy of global operations. More than that we needed one true grandmaster. Humanity was never satisfied with the prospect of two winners. We needed a spectacle of blood from which only one would rise.  \n\nThe tournament was organized. Hiran and Aiguo prepared as best as they could, reading previous matches, playing against machines. \n\nAs they walked into the auditorium the audience clapped, and rose to its feet. Hiran was in a flamboyant red suit. He blew kisses to the audience, he caught a rose a fan threw at him, smelled it and handed it to another who had jumped over the barricade to congratulate him. He kissed her before security pulled her away. That was Hiran, the showman.  \n\nAiguo walked in in his hooded jacket and jeans, his headphones covering his ears. He too got a standing ovation. The solitudinous genius. He took of his headphones and waved at the crowd. He pointed sternly at one of his fans. He could already read that they were planning to jump over and run to him. He didn't need the perverted thoughts interrupting his calculating process.  \n\nThey shook hands before taking opposing seats. As the coin was tossed Aiguo's eyes widened. He could hear everyone, the critics, the fans, even the judges struggling to feign disinterest. He looked at Hiran. He could hear him, the only problem was his thoughts were in Sanskrit, a language he had never learned. English was already taught as a a first language world wide. He had never thought he would meet someone, let alone such an international figure who did not think in it.  \n\nThen a thought escaped Hiran as the timer started, \"Did you think I wouldn't prepare for you, mindreader? I already saw your future, you lose to me.\" Then once more Hiran's thoughts faded to a chatter of Sanskrit as he lifted a pawn.    \n\n***\n\n/r/pagefighter  \n\n   \n"}, {"author": "kobrakai_1986", "score": 7266, "prompt": " Humans are the first sentients, putting us millenia ahead of aliens.

An impressive amount, I thought, but nothing to brag about. \n\nOf course, no one really bragged about anything anymore. Everyone was too scared, too worried that their swagger would provoke others to use the Law. The same had happened with almost all conversation, really. Everyone was polite, everyone was nice, and, most of all, everyone was quiet. It was a remarkable transformation from the busy, bustling society I had known all my life; in just a few months, the Law had created a world walking on egg-shells.\n\nExcept for the Question. No one shied away from it, no one blanched at it. Some even asked it with an excited grin, full of glee at the prospect of finding out someone's Silence. Some still saw any answer other than 'No' as an excuse to return to old habits, though many found themselves Silenced soon enough.\n\nThe first months of the Law had been complete and utter chaos. Old rivalries, feuds and petty squabbles were settled with a Silence, and the world was overcome with an unbounded paranoia. Homelessness was all but eradicated as Silences were used to 'clean the streets'. The gay community was near wiped out by the end of the second month. The entire world was caught in the cold, vice-like grip of fear.\n\nNot even world leaders were above the Law's reach, and by the end of the first month we were looking at a completely new global political stage. By the second month we were looking at an even newer one. Constant change became the norm as the old order was Silenced by the new, and the new Silenced by the newer.\n\nEven in the politeness and the cautiousness that followed, that chaos persists. The wealthy, for all their pomp and bought security, are Silenced almost daily, while the poor are Silenced for the simple fact of their existence. It is the elderly, surprisingly, who use their Silence the most, Silencing people almost arbitrarily so as not to waste the opportunity granted by the Law. Just the other day, in fact, I witnessed an old woman, clad in a thick tweed overcoat with an even thicker tartan scarf wrapped around her gaunt throat, Silence a man on the bus for refusing to give up his seat. He was disabled.\n\nThe newspapers are all saying the same thing now; the Law is growing out of control. People are seeing through the niceties of polite society that the Law had created, and using their Silence simply because they can.

Growing up is like looking both ways before you cross the street, then getting hit by an airplane.\" He lowered his head as if to put his thoughts together, then continued. \"It's the things you don't expect that catch you by surprise.

It sucks, but we all know what we're getting into.\" He sighed. \"No, what catches you by \nsurprise are the little things about growing up. It's being stuck in traffic and remembering a day. Any day. A locker \nroom conversation in high school. A teacher. A friend of a friend. Something that happened long enough ago that \nit could order its own drink. It sneaks up on you, and you look at yourself in the rear view and you think, my \nGod\u2026 where did it go? When did I become so old?\n\n\"I remember college like it was yesterday. I remember my girlfriends and my friends and they used to drink and \ntalk about sex and hanging out and now they all eat oatmeal and go to funerals. And I do that to, and I *like* all of that. Well, not going to funerals, but oatmeal. Soap operas. Going to bed at nine. I like it.\"\n\n\"So what's the problem?\"\n\n\"The problem is I'm still the sixteen year old. I'm still the college kid. My needs and wants have changed, and my \nbody has changed, and my mind has changed, in a way, but *I* didn't change. I'm still putting on a face. So when \nthese thoughts sneak up on me \u2013 when a flash of a college party or a roadtrip or the feeling of falling asleep in the \nback of my Dad's car wells up on me\u2026 it breaks me. It breaks me because I don't think of it fondly. I don't look at \nthat young kid with affection and nostalgia, I look at him with envy. Envy, because he's got all of that ahead of him \nstill, and he doesn't even know how lucky he is. He's me, we're the same \u2013 but he's got the good looks and the \nhealth and all the years ahead of him, and I'm wasting away in an old apartment. And I hate that kid so much. Every time he sneaks up on me I hate him more.\"\n\nI looked down, then up. \"What about family? Kids?\"\n\n\"They are great. They are amazing. But they go away. They're not *you*. In the end, you raise your sons and \ndaughters for the world, not for yourself. They have to fall asleep in the back of *my* car, and go to *their* college parties and all that\u2026 they don't exist for my benefit. No one exists for my benefit but myself. And I'm much too old to do anything about it.\"\n\nI swallowed dry and averted my eyes to the fireplace. The old man leaned forward. \"We always get the feeling that \nthe good old days are either behind us or ahead of us. They're never our own days. We were always born just a \nbit too late to go to Woodstock or to see Nirvana live or to see the Berlin Wall fall or to party Great Gatsby style in the 20's. And then we get old and we realize we were born too soon to see the wonders of technology and the world reshaping and blooming into something new and exciting. But the truth is, our Woodstocks were happening all around us as we grew. Our new and exciting world was some old guy's boring present, and our past will be some spoiled, arrogant kid's 'Good old days'. We were just too stupid to realize it when it mattered. So we let it slide away. And then we ended up like me \u2013 sad and resentful of our younger selves for all they can still do and we can't.\"\n\nFinally, I got up. I went to the old man and I knelt in front of him. \"I'm sorry I brought you over.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" he said. \"I knew you would. After all, I did it, sixty years ago.\"\n\nI looked at my own eyes. Despite the wrinkles around them, they still looked pretty much the same. The old man \nshook his head and sniffed a tear away. \"Now let's go back to your lab so you can send me back to my own time, \nso I can hate you in peace.\"\n\nI hugged my own eighty year old version and leaned away and nodded. \"I'll enjoy it,\" I said. \"And I'll know I'm living in the good old days, I promise.\"\n\nHe got up with difficulty. \"No, you won't,\" he said. \"The good old days are only ever good when they're gone. That's what makes them good. When you're living through them, they're just... days.\"\n\nHe slow-stepped ahead of me towards the lab. Then he spoke without turning his head: \"And days go by really fast, man. They go by really fast.\"\n\n\n________________\n\n*Thank you for reading!

One night, while watching a falling star from my backyard, I got so fed up with *not* knowing what I was good at that I wished for the ability to find out. I only wanted to know *my* best skill; in hindsight, I should have been more specific.\n\nThe first trip was utterly terrifying. One warm August, at the age of 17, I didn\u2019t wake up in my own bed ready to go to class. I woke up in the body of a grown man, tall and strong. I wasn\u2019t in control of the body, though: more like a passenger. Able to observe, but not change. We had a big protein smoothie for breakfast, then we went out and won the U.S. Open. I learned that this man\u2019s skill was tennis: after that win, he was officially ranked best in the world.\n\nThose are the easy ones. Hell, some of them I\u2019ve already heard of from watching the Olympics or whatever. I can identify their skill pretty much as soon they open their eyes and look in the mirror. And then I\u2019m thrown back into my own body like I never left. Well, almost: I always get just a little nugget of their skill. I won\u2019t be winning Wimbledon any time soon, but my serve is much improved since that experience. Part of them comes back with me. \n\nSome of them are a bit more difficult to recognize, but it becomes apparent once they use their skill. I spent a week living on the banks of the Ganges river as a 60 year old woman, trying to figure out what the hell she was known for. Then the rains came and one of her baskets broke. Within *minutes* she had woven a new one so tightly that it could be used to get water from the river. Best basketmaker in the world. I\u2019ve also lived as the world\u2019s best fisherman, best violinist, best realtor, speedcuber, and even the world\u2019s best yo-yoer(who, might I add, is far more full of himself than any other expert I\u2019ve been in). None of them have taken more than a few weeks to recognize, because the best at anything always has to practice their skill.\n\nThis time it\u2019s different. I\u2019ve been here for 2 months now, and this guy, Alan, is the most mundane person I\u2019ve ever met. He sells oil rig machinery for a living, so we spend most of our time driving around the Gulf Coast, staying in one crappy motel after another. And he\u2019s not a particularly good salesman either, so that can\u2019t be it. He doesn\u2019t seem to do anything else with his time. When not working, he reads, watches TV\u2026. Nothing.\n\n---\n\nAlan rose from the bed and opened his eyes. I was barely even paying attention anymore because of how boring this guy\u2019s life was. *Oh boy, another breakfast of cheerios,* I thought. *Same as every other morning.* But then I realized that it was still dark outside.\n\nAlan didn\u2019t put on his normal work suit. He put on one of those Adidas track suits with the three stripes down the side. I\u2019d never seen him wear that before. *Are we going running or something? Maybe he\u2019s an ultramarathoner*. That one would certainly be a trait I\u2019d like to take back; I\u2019ve got the stamina of a jellyfish. But that idea went out the window when he went into the bathroom and put on a wig and makeup. I\u2019d never seen that before either. We came out looking like a completely different person; a woman, actually. *Best\u2026. Burlesque show performer?*\n\nWe got into the car. Now I *was* eagerly paying attention. It was finally getting interesting. Alan jumped on the interstate going 70 and headed inland. He didn\u2019t seem to have a particular destination in mind, and just pulled off at a random exit. \n\nThere was *nothing* there. Even the McDonalds at this truck stop of a town wasn\u2019t open 24 hours a day. Only the gas station\u2019s lights were still on. Alan drove until he found a random house with darkened windows. I was desperately trying to think of how this might reveal his skill. Was he a CIA agent or something? Was he a master thief?\n\nHe didn\u2019t knock on the door; we went in through a broken basement window. The answer was looking more and more like \u2018thief\u2019 as Alan crept up the stairs and through their kitchen. But why was the world\u2019s greatest thief breaking into some random home in a run-down suburb that had seen better days? Shouldn\u2019t he be, like\u2026 breaking into the Louvre or something?\n\nIn the kitchen, Alan grabbed a knife from the countertop. *Oooooh no,* I thought. *No, no, no*. I was helpless to stop him as he entered a child\u2019s bedroom and plunged the knife through a Dora the Explorer blanket on the bed. The girl\u2019s scream awoke her parents, who came running right into Alan\u2019s trap and were stabbed in the back as they rushed to their daughter\u2019s bedside. After this, I had to shut my eyes as Alan carried out a gruesome ritual and began to clean up the bodies. Before we left, he hand-wrote Hallmark cards from the \u201cFarewell\u201d section of the local pharmacy and left the cards on their bodies.\n\nThe next morning, Alan rose from his bed and ate his cheerios like nothing was wrong. As usual, the morning news was on the television, and maybe he paid more attention to it than normal. Finally I felt a surge of joy ripple through him as the story that he\u2019d been waiting for came on: the Greeting Card Killer strikes again. I finally realized Alan\u2019s skill and vanished from his mind.\n\n-----\n\nI\u2019ve never felt so good to be back in control of my own body. I couldn\u2019t even get out of bed; I just shivered in horror and vomited over the side as I relived last night's events. But then I realized that I *knew* Alan. I knew his name, where he was staying, where he\u2019d hidden the evidence. I knew everything! I dashed into the kitchen and picked up my phone to dial 9-11.\n\nFrom the corner of my eye, I spotted a knife gleaming on the counter. And as a wave of nervous energy and excitement sent a chill down my spine, I also realized what I\u2019d brought back from my time with Alan.\n\n----\n\nIf you liked this one, you should subscribe to /r/Luna_Lovewell for a ton of other stories!\n"}, {"author": "Jimmyg100", "score": 6418, "prompt": " Aliens have arrived and have been eating humans like a delicacy.

At sunset, the woodworker Anatoly would knock on the apartment door with his wheelbarrow beside him.  Anatoly would give Elena all the plain figurines that he had carved that day, curving the balsam wood into the prospect of a head, shoulders and torso, then cutting the doll at her waist so that her legs would twist off, and hide her secrets.  Elena would pay Anatoly five hundred rubles for each full matryoshka and then she would go to her workshop (which was in fact only just the corner of her father's kitchen behind the stove) and she would paint the wood into beautiful women.\n  \nElena would paint the women with long eyelashes and blushing cheeks, and Elena would wonder what it would feel like to blush and flutter her own eyes, if ever a kind and handsome man were to pour vodka into a glass, and hand it to her, letting his fingertips pass over hers.  She would paint the women wearing elegant dresses adorned with tulips and roses, and Elena would imagine sewing an elegant silk dress to wear herself.  She would give the woman full-hearted smiles, and Elena would try to remember the last time she had smiled, apart from when she meant to attract the customers to her booth at the Udelnaya.  And then she would paint the next doll nested within, more intricately, but otherwise the same.  However, at their core, Elena's matryoshka contained a protest: open her dolls up to the final girl, the smallest and deepest girl of all, and you will find that she is not smiling or blushing, but instead has short eyelashes and a stern gaze. She wears only a plain grey dress.  For though Elena painted matryoshka, she had never known her own mother, and therefore knew that not all daughters will inherit.\n\nIn the morning, Elena would pack her matryoshka in a box and take the bus to the Udelnaya, hoping to sell her work.  Most days, she would be lucky to sell two or three matryoshka.  But there was one day when she sold none at all, yet left the Udelnaya joyful. On that day, a certain tall man in a white dress shirt had come to the market.  There, he saw Elena at her booth with the shelves of matryoshka behind her, all red and green, gold and blue, and the man was enamored.  \n\n\"I have never seen a woman who I am more certain has a secret hiding inside her,\" the man said to Elena.  He was wearing a gold watch and many silver rings.  Elena told him that he could buy as many matryoshka as he wished, and discover everything within them.  But then the man said the woman he meant to describe was not any of the matryoshka, but Elena herself.\n\nThe man gave Elena a piece of paper with directions to an elegant restaurant on the banks of the Moyka River. He he gave her his credit card as well.  He told Elena that were she to go buy a nice dress, that he would be honored to see her in it, and dine with her that evening.  Elena blushed, and then she smiled, even though she had not sold a matryoshka.\n\nThat evening, instead of painting, Elena went to the best boutique in St Petersburg, and she bought a beautiful silk dress.  She then met the man at the appointed restaurant.  He spread caviar onto crackers for her, and poured her some vodka.  He asked her about her life, how many matryoshka she supposed she had painted, and if any were very special to her.  But, as the meal continued, Elena began to feel more and more confused and dizzy, until everything became terribly blurry.  When Elena awoke, she was no longer in the restaurant or in the small bed beside her father's.  She was standing upright, but frozen in pose, perched on a gold podium in a white expanse, more still and desolate than the Tauride Gardens after the first snowfall.  Elena was lined up neatly between a hundred other young women, all immobile as well.\n\n\"Where am I\" Elena asked, \"who are you all?\"\n\n\"That man who gave you a dress and dinner,\" the young woman beside her explained, \"was not in truth a man, but the wicked god of Motherless Girls.  He keeps us here as figurines, upon his shelf for all eternity.  He tells us that long ago, he once loved a goddess called Anna, who also had no mother, who was the First Woman, and that we remind him of her.  When Anna birthed their child, the girl was mortal.  So the god sought to kill the child as an abomination.  But Anna loved the baby, so she fled the heavens to the Barsky taiga.  The god chased her all through the trees, but Anna refused to return, and at last a bargain was struck: she would remain in the Barsky with her daughter, but thereafter Anna would become mortal as well.  But, if any of her descendants to ever live without a mother, the god would be entitled to reclaim those girls and bring them here, to remain forever in his collection.\"\n\nElena was crestfallen at the thought of never again seeing her father or St Petersburg, and of being frozen in place.  She screamed out to the god of Motherless Girls and demanded to be freed.  But the god just laughed, all throughout his menagerie.  \n\nBut then, after many days of considering her plight, Elena formed a plan.  \"Allow me to turn your collection into matryoshka!,\" she called out to the god, \"Let me separate each of these women into pieces, into clear layers, so that you might consider each part of her more easily, and find what it is in each of us that resembles your beloved Anna!\"\n\nElena's proposal thrilled the god, for even after all his abductions, he was still no closer to grasping what it was that makes a motherless woman so special, so like the First Woman.  He released Elena's muscles and demanded that she go to work at once, separating and straining each of his women into a partwise matryoshka.  \n\nFrom where the god watched, it appeared to him Elena was doing as she had promised.  But each time his back was turned, or when Elena carefully angled her subject and stood nose to nose, she would reach inside the girl, and she would pull forth her soul, which lives in her deepest layer.  Elena would hide the soul in her bosom until she could move on and quietly feed it to another girl, until every girl had taken in the soul of one of her fellow captives.  Finally, Elena pulled out her own soul and fed it to the woman whom she had been first placed beside.  At last, each captive woman had taken in the soul of another, thereby promising to care for it and nurture it.  Because of this, the women of the menagerie had all become mothers to each other, and were no longer in thrall to the selfish god.\n\nThe god saw that Elena was no longer hard at work, so he returned to inspect her progress.  But as he entered the menagerie, all the captives suddenly broke from their poses.  All together, they hit and kicked the god, until he fled.  The menagerie with all its gold podiums vanished, and the girls fell through a void, until everything again became blurry. Elena awoke in her small bed in her father's apartment in St Petersburg.\n\nThat night, Anatoly came at sunset with the blank wood for Elena.  For the first time, she did not paint the final doll with a stern face and grey dress.  For now, Elena knew that somewhere there was a woman who would always carry her soul, always nurture and protect it, and that this meant she would always have a mother to inherit from.\n   "}, {"author": "Aldrath_Shadowborn", "score": 6404, "prompt": " You are a phone.

Extermination maybe. Though I\u2019d more aptly describe it as a harvest. By the time they reached our world and penetrated the stratosphere, people sought them out in droves to be harvested. Of course, they knew what that actually meant. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have been so eager.\n\nTen years before the *Angels* descended from the sky, they had already sent what some referred to as divine retribution: a virus. Though this virus in particular only targeted women. It spread faster than a wildfire and had a 100% mortality rate. Worse yet, it was completely undetectable. In our desperation, we became animals. We locked our wives, daughters, and mothers deep underground under the constant shine of UV radiation and still they got infected. Within five years, the last woman had died leaving the rest of humanity to slowly die with her.\n\nBy the time they arrived, we welcomed them with open arms into every one of our major cities. Most bowed their heads and practically begged to be killed. Some fought against them. These were the ones that still remembered the pain of watching their daughters, wives, and mothers die. They couldn\u2019t hope to survive, but at least they could enact their own version of divine retribution.\n\nLooking back at it now, I know that the *Angels* planned for them. They wanted us to retaliate. Otherwise, where would be the fun? Men charged at them by the millions. Some to die. Some to kill. To the *Angels*, it was all the same.\n\nUntil we killed the first one.\n\nBack when I used to write, I always made sure to name my hero something memorable. If not a strange name, then certainly a strange title. Evan the Incorruptible. Matthew the Harbinger. But in real life, heroes rarely have titles, some don\u2019t even have names. That was the case for humanity\u2019s last hero because nobody knew who he was.\n\nWe had only stories. The stories ranged from fantastical to downright fiction, but they always ended the same. We had killed one. The *Angels* must\u2019ve been as skeptical as we were because they refused to change their tactics. They kept all our major cities and welcomed anyone to try and take it back.\n\nBy the fifth dead *Angel*, they learned of their miscalculation. Soon, we learned of it as well. Human beings shared mana and with it, we could do wondrous or terrible things. Magic no longer belonged to the realm of fiction. The elements bent to our will. Lightning struck where we pointed, tornados formed where we stood, the ground swallowed up entire cities as we willed it.\n\nSuddenly, men stopped volunteering to be harvested. With their newfound power, they decided to fight back, even if victory had already been stolen from us. They had turned us into animals and then backed us into a corner. Foolish.\n\nAnd that was good enough for us. Looking back, I wonder if we were as foolish as the *Angels*. We, who were content with dying in our little blazes of glory, having accomplished nothing but thinning their ranks by just a bit. It was selfish, but what is there to expect from men who had nothing else to live for?\n\nNone of us had the vision you had. The vision you have.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nTyler put the pen down, staring at the word *you*. He wondered if his letter would ever find its way to this certain *you*. While humanity had become animals, one man had gone even further. He had been called a monster by both *Angel* and man. Nobody knew which side he fought for, only that he killed both indiscriminately.\n\nIf Tyler were to write his story, he wouldn\u2019t know whether to make this man the villain or the hero. Oh how he wished he could\u2019ve written this story, but the only way this story continued was if he died. Beside his letter and pen, sitting at the edge of his wooden table was a silver revolver. The single lightbulb above him glinted off its barrel.\n\nA small grin spread across Tyler\u2019s face. He grabbed the gun, its metal like ice, and pressed it to his temple. Enough humans had died where he could stop the bullet with only his thoughts. The bullet couldn\u2019t even hurt him unless he wanted it to. But he did. For the sake of humanity, he needed the bullet to kill him.\n\nWith his free hand, he picked the pen back up.\n\n---\n\n---\n\nAs the last storyteller on Earth, I bestow you the title of Reaper. A monster. A villain. Our last hero.\n\nGo forth, Reaper, my death as an offering. With my passing, there will be only four humans left.

By then, your mind will stretch the globe, perhaps even the stars.

I nudge out of the hug to follow Dodger, up the stairs, up to Master's room.\n\n\"Hey Sapphire,\" says the Mistress when I enter. She rubs me behind the ears the way I like.

He lays his head on Master's chest, who looks asleep. The chemicals make me want to sneeze, but Dodger had told me that is disrespectful. There's another smell too: it's been present for a long time, but today it is stronger than before.\n\nI walk up to the side of the bed. \"Dodger!\" I speak loudly to get his attention.\n\nHe opens his big brown eyes. \"Quiet, pup,\" he says. \"And go away.\"\n\n\"No!

He lifts his head from Master's chest. \"My family was made part of the Master's family generations ago, when he was just a pup.\" Dodger looks at his Master's face. \"The First was named Dodger as well.

He catches me near the ears again, gently. \"I told you, Dodger will take care of me.\"\n\nI whine at them both. \"You can't leave!\"\n\nThe men come upstairs with a bed on wheels.

I whine at the Lady, but she just holds me and cries.\n\n\"He can't leave!\" I tell her, but she doesn't understand yet. \"They won't bring him back!\"\n\nBut he does leave.

I get free.\n\n\"Dodger, we have to bring the Master back!\" I tell him. I could still hear the vehicles on the road. The Lady was running up behind me.\n\nHe wags his tail at me. \"He told you to be a good dog and take care of the Lady. Be good, Sapphire.\" He licks my face and runs off, golden fur shining in the sunlight. Lady holds onto me and calls for Dodger, but he disobeys. I had never seen him disobey before. He had never called me by my name before.\n\nI only saw Dodger one more time: we found him at the meadow where the Master's body was laid, curled against the crossed stone that marked it.\n\nHe was the Seventh of his family.

They came from a sinkhole in the ocean that our scientists determined to be a mechanism much like a wormhole. Then came the ones that wanted our Earth. They crashed into our planet on a thousand meteorite-like vehicles made of a substance unknown to our universe. And at last, the ones who wanted our air and the ones who wanted our water. They came together from portals that eviscerated our poles. One for the south pole, the other for the north. Each had accomplished feats that had left our scientists baffled. And what was even more troubling--they all resembled humans.\n\nWe had tried greeting the ones who wanted our fire. We had sent them presents, precious metals, and the welcoming smile of our most expert convoys. They retaliated with a tsunami that wiped out Japan. It was magic, real magic. Something we had previously thought only existed in Hollywood and cartoons. With a few incantations, they could manipulate the water, the earth, even the air that we breathed. But they could not touch fire. So we gave them what they wanted. Napalm, incendiary bombs, hellfire missiles. They wanted our fire so bad? I hoped they like our gifts.\n\nThings were desperate but humanity was always at its best when pushed to the edge. Then came the Earth-Takers. At first, we had thought they were here to aid us in the invasion. They seemed enemies to the Fire-Takers and as the old saying goes--*the enemy of my enemy...* But though they were quick to attack each other, they were even quicker to attack us. These new aliens, they wanted our earth. So we gave it to those bastards with steel-tipped bullets, titanium-plated tanks, and a kinetic bombardment of tungsten launched from our satellites.\n\nBy the times the portals opened in the north and south poles, we already knew what to do.\n\nThese aliens looked like us but that was where the similarities ended. Everything they had ever wanted they had accomplished through magic. What would've taken humans years to do, they could simply chant and incantation to do so.\n\nThank God we never fell into the folly of magic. They have no idea what it means to move mountains by hand, to  conquer the skies armed only with dirt and stone, to create the greatest weapons in our known universe because we were pushed that far into the corner. Aliens this weak would never snuff out humanity.\n\nThat I promise you.\n\n---\n\nMichelle's pen stopped at the period. The walls around her shook. Bits of dirt crumbled from the ceiling onto her desk. The lights swayed, dancing the shadows around her. She had spent all night on this letter. It was the last one she would ever write and the first aimed at humanity's next generation, the generation of soldiers who had never experienced an alien free Earth.\n\n\"Michelle,\" came a voice from behind.\n\nShe turned to see her First General, Paxon, his feet together, shoulders stiff, and arms held to his head in salute. They had started the Resistance together when the governments crumbled and countries fell. At first, it had simply been a way to quell their anger as the other aliens fought for lands rightfully theirs.\n\nBlow a hole in a supply chain. Sabotage key communications. Small-scale things. But just as the aliens had done, she had underestimated humanity's grit. A million calls, e-mails, texts flooded her servers and as she strung them all together, the Resistance was born.\n\n\"At ease, General,\" she said.\n\nPaxon lowered his arm. \"Commander Gladstead, the Earth-Takers are approaching from the North in war balloons. Initial scouts report a tornado of fire dragged behind them.\"\n\nMichelle smiled at her friend. \"*At ease*,\" she said. \"Commander Gladstead? You sound like a grunt.\" She had always hated that title--commander. In a previous life, she was a pre-school teacher and now, men of the highest positions of power all reported to her.\n\nHer friend's shoulder dropped. \"As you command, Michelle.\" But this he said with a crescent grin. He knew how power annoyed her.\n\nShe ignored his smile. \"How are we holding up against the Fire-Takers?\"\n\n\"Still at a stale-mate, but not for long. We're almost out of missiles and our soldiers on the ground are being swallowed by the Earth itself.\"\n\nMichelle nodded. Not good news, but good enough. \"And at our East and West?\"\n\n\"The others are approaching. Their scouts are already here with their armies soon to follow.\"\n\nShe chuckled. Victory was always so bittersweet. \"Paxon,\" she said, \"get out of here. Tell everyone not in combat to do the same.\"\n\nHe didn't move. He pressed his lips together and stared at Michelle, humanity's commander, the last bastion of their old world, his friend. \"Come with me,\" he said, pleaded.\n\n\"We don't fool magic,\" Michelle said, a grin parting between her lips. \"They all came knowing full well that this is a trap and that's because the bait is just too good to pass off. Look at that, Michelle from podunk Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the greatest military asset in the world. Not bad, eh?\"\n\nPaxon coughed out a chuckle. He took a small breath and gritted his teeth. \"Commander, it's been an honor.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, General, I'll show them just how high the price is for the Resistance Commander.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\" The general straightened up, every one of his muscles stiff. He jabbed his forehead with his hand and returned Michelle the sharpest salute she had ever seen. Without another word, he left.\n\n\"Give 'em hell, General,\" Michelle whispered to the back of his head. She watched even as he turned the corner and disappeared into the underground corridors of their bunker. \n\nDrops of water followed him out.\n\nThe ground shook again. Another aftershock, another earthquake. Michelle stared at her letter. She nodded and put pen to paper.\n\n---\n\nWe are about to unleash the deadliest weapon humanity has ever conceived. We call it the hydrogen bomb. It is the combination of every single one of our elemental powers.

Why did you just shoot my wallet? And why is it moving?\" \n\nHe pulls his wide-brim hat up, fixing me with one of the dark eyes resting underneath. \"Mimic,\" he says, as if the word alone will solve everything.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You heard me.

They take any inanimate form they can find, trying to trick people into opening them.\" \n\nI open my mouth to retort, but he shuts me up by simply jabbing his gun in the direction of my wallet. I spare it a glance, and see that a viscous, black liquid oozes from the bullet hole within it. Its ends rise and fall, as if breathing, and suddenly I notice the thin white ivory lining its edges - almost too small for an untrained eye to see. Teeth, and rows upon rows of them. Sharpened and blood-flecked. \n\n\"What the fuc-\" \n\n\"Next time you opened it, you'd have been in for a nasty surprise, kid.\" \n\nHis head cocks back, and I hear a suppressed gasp of surprise follow. His casual demeanour quickly dissipates as he dives forward, tackling me to the ground. We fall back in a heap, my back painfully slamming into the concrete below as he presses a single finger to my lips, his eyes wide with fear. \"Dont. Move. A. Muscle.\"\n\nI nod, tilting my head to hazard a view at whatever is behind him. I wish I hadn't. A strained, heavy breathing precedes something purposefully slinking forwards a few feet in front us. Its back is arched predatorily, and I can see each bone that's formed underneath its gaunt, grey skin. The further upwards I look, the more cracked and twisted its skin seems to get, until towards what seems to be its spindly neck the skin breaks entirely, curling outwards like the petals of a flower to reveal an expressionless head popping out; the head of a beautiful woman, accentuated by makeup and sultry, half-lidded eyes. \n\nThe creature growls - a low, guttural sound that eventually progresses into a high-pitched giggle. \n\n\"Come on out and *play*, we don't bite.\" \n\n\"Goddamn it, I didn't think one of those would be here,\" the man atop me says, moving his arm from my shoulder to reach for something tucked into his jacket. From it, he pulls a glinting, golden bullet, replacing one currently resting in his gun's cylinder with it. He steadies himself, stance wide and body motionless, holding out the gun in front of him with two hands and peering down the sight, one eye fixed tightly shut. \n\nHe begins to squeeze the trigger and, just as he does, the gun appears to whirl with energy, practically screeching as a golden wreathe of light begins to surround it. The abomination in front of us turns to see it, beginning to charge towards us with an ear shattering screech. \n\n\"Kid, you never saw this happen.\" \n\nHe squeezes the trigger and the bullet explodes out of the muzzle. The gun proceeds to burst into flame, causing him to toss it out of his grasp as the bullet flies wide, a path of searing light left in its wake. I notice as the bullet peaks miles up into the sky it begins to arch, curling in midair. \n\nThe mimic follows it for a moment before turning back to us with a cackle. \"You had me worried there, Paladin. Pity you're getting old; your aim untrue. You almost would've been a fun catch otherwise.\" \n\nThe man simply says nothing, raising his hands in surrender as the mimic takes a menacing step towards us before suddenly lurching forwards, letting out a slight gasp. Black blood splatters to the ground as all eyes come to rest on a hole that has been left in place of where its thin chest formerly was, smouldering at the seams. With a moan, it collapses to its knees and, after a moment of shaking, its entire body falls limp, lifeless. \n\n\"Aim ain't what it used to be - sorry if that scared you,\" the man says, awkwardly scratching at his stubble. \n\nI'm too beside myself with confusion to complain. I just witnessed what could only be described as magic - plain and simple. A bullet curving in midair. \"Wh-what happened?\" I say, somehow finding within me the strength to summon my meek voice. \n\n\"Smote the fucker.\" \n\n\"Ok.... last question. *What* are you?\" \n\n\"I'm a Paladin, kid.

A hatred for the women who ruled that world, \nwho cast away the 'men', who deemed them bad and evil, who condemned him without ever meeting him, ever \nknowing who he was or what he thought, judged and trialed and convicted him over a prejudice of the past, over shadowy figures that walked the Earth before he was born.\n\nIf men were evil, he wasn't men. He was something else. But he *was* men, his mother said so. So men couldn't \nall be evil. So women were evil, because women judged him, determined he was bad without ever meeting him.

Even the persnickety, old grandmothers, who spent their mornings hotly debating the proper manner by which to weave the straw hats and tapestries for the turistas, and afternoons arguing over the proper proportion of onion, garlic, cilantro, and plantain for the moqueca, unanimously agreed that Ana Clara was the favela's most beautiful daughter.\n\nAna Clara was so lovely that young men of notable wealth would come from Leblon to meet her. They would come wearing pinstriped suits with shiny shoes and gold tie pins. To win Ana Clara\u2019s affection, the men would bring her gifts of lavender soap, silver hairbrushes, and DVDs of American films, and they would fire their pistols to boast of their marksmanship (though, after catching a glimpse of Ana Clara's bare shoulders peeking above her dress, they would often miss their targets altogether). In each case, Ana Clara would thank the young man for his gifts and praise his talents, but politely decline his offer of marriage, citing the fact that he did not truly love her.\n\nThe young man would assure Ana Clara that he did indeed love her, so she would then hold up two objects: the first, an hourglass full of sand, and the second, a wooden box full of mosquitoes. Ana Clara would challenge the gentleman that if he loved her, he would place his hand in the box with the mosquitoes for as long as it took the overturned hourglass to settle. If he did this, she would consent to marry him at once. The men always refused, promptly driving back to Leblon in their fast cars.  Of course, it was Ana Clara's secret that the box had never truly held any mosquitoes. The men simply proved how they could never understand a girl from the favela by revealing how they feared the uncertain.\n\nThere was, however, one young man who truly did love Ana Clara, and that was Pedro the bus driver. Pedro had known Ana Clara since they were both children. He knew that she could only fall asleep to the sound of the wind rattling against the thin scrap metal roof above her mattress, and that she would only awaken to the coos of pigeons fighting over scraps in the street. He knew that she had taught herself arithmetic and that she took great pride in how her ledger of the various debts and credits in the favela was by far the most precise and reputable. He knew that her father had left, and for this reason she did not trust easily. But as much as Pedro loved Ana Clara, and even though they had always been dear friends to each other, he feared two things. He feared that he was not good enough for her and he feared the box of mosquitoes.\n\nBut as time passed, Pedro\u2019s love for Ana Clara only grew stronger, in particular on those nights when they would samba dance together underneath the canopy of flickering Christmas lights outside the caf\u00e9, as the old men sat on white plastic chairs, smoking cigarettes, strumming guitars, and rattling maracas. On his way to his bus in the mornings, Pedro would see Ana Clara wrestle the young girls onto her lap to teach them their shapes and letters from a creased, dog-eared workbook, and she would smile at him as her captive tried to wriggle free. Soon, Pedro knew he could not endure another day in the favela without Ana Clara by his side.\n\nOf course, as everyone knows, the favela is ruled by twin gods: the God of Courage and the God of Misfortune (who always appear as a mangy dog cradled by a footballer with a broken leg).  One night, after Pedro and Ana Clara had danced and drank and smoked at the cafe, after he had placed a begonia behind her ear and left her at her doorstep, Pedro prayed to the Twin Gods to help him.  Soon, he heard his name called from the alleyway, where he saw a footballer smiling over an old charcoal grill, feeding bits of sausage to a mangy pup.  Pedro approached the Twin Gods, who said that they would give him the strength to declare himself to Ana Clara, but that he must in turn serve them.\n\nThe Twin Gods showed Pedro a duffel bag.  It was stuffed full of heroina. They explained that if Pedro wanted Ana Clara, then he must agree to give heroina to all the boys and girls of the favela until the bag was empty. Pedro hated heroina, how it turned brothers against brothers and sons against mothers. But Pedro loved Ana Clara more than he hated anything. He accepted the contract. He shook hands with the footballer, let the mangy pup lick his wrist, and picked up the duffel bag of heroina. Suddenly, feeling full of vigor, he sprinted off to Ana Clara. He ran back through the favela so carelessly that he nearly knocked down a row of rusty scooters.\n\nPedro shook Ana Clara awake and demanded that she allow him to prove his love for her. He said he was prepared to pass her test, right then and there. But instead of showing him the hourglass and the box of mosquitoes, Ana Clara laughed at him and then kissed him. \n\n\u201cMy test is for men who do not know me,\u201d she said, \u201cIt is for men who do not know how a clanging roof relaxes me or why a ledger of debts and credits makes me proud. It is for men who did not learn the samba for me and who have never walked me home from the caf\u00e9. You do not need to take the test to prove you love me, Pedro, for I already love you!\u201d\n\nWhen Pedro heard this, he was overjoyed. He could have Ana Clara and he need not invite pain on the favela. He took the duffel bag and poured every last bit of heroina down into the sewer. But the Twin Gods of Courage and Misfortune saw this, and were dismayed. A bargain had been struck and, in the favela, there can be no pure victories.\n\nOn the night of Pedro and Ana Clara\u2019s wedding, the entire favela gathered at the caf\u00e9 to eat brigadeiro and drink caipirinha. Ana Clara wore a white dress she had sewn herself and a crown of begonia. Pedro put a simple steel ring on her finger.  Everyone mingled and took photographs, but as the party roared on, an enormous swarm of mosquitoes approached from the north, covering the food and drinks and guests, until everyone was forced to run back to their homes. Pedro asked Ana Clara if she had been stung.  She said that she had been, but that she was still happy they were now married. He said it was the happiest day of his life.\n\nShortly thereafter, Ana Clara became pregnant. The pregnancy was very difficult, causing her to sweat and cramp terribly. But Ana Clara and Pedro had no money to see a doctor in the city, and eventually, she gave birth at home. But when she went to cradle her newborn daughter\u2019s head for the first time, she began to scream and cry. Pedro pushed past the midwives to investigate the commotion. Ana Clara showed him his daughter. The child's head was shaped like a football that had been punctured by a nail. Unlike her mother, she would never become the most beautiful girl in the favela.\n\nPedro knew who was responsible for this cruel punishment. He ran into the humid night, back to the alleyway with the old charcoal girll, and he called out to the Twin Gods of Courage and Misfortune. He demanded they reverse this crime, for he had never drawn upon their blessing. \u201cMortal, you delude yourself!\u201d the Twin Gods replied, \u201cYou feared not only the mosquitoes, but also Ana Clara herself! We gave you courage, indeed. Now we give you your misfortune!\u201d\n\nPedro sat down in the alleyway and wept. Why should his innocent daughter be forced to pay his debts? He climbed down into the sewer to try to recover the heroina and honor his contract with the Twin Gods. For days he searched everywhere for the heroina, among the rats and filth, but it was no use.\n\nBuried in the waste, Pedro found only part of a broken bottle. He resolved that he would use that bottle take his life. He had never truly deserved Ana Clara. He had only brought misery to her and their daughter. They would be better off without him.\n\nBut as Pedro raised the bottle to his neck, the Twin Gods were impressed by his Courage.  They appeared once again with a new contract. They told Pedro that they would restore his daughter to proper health. But in exchange, Pedro would be transformed into a mosquito.  Each day he would return to land on Ana Clara's arm or leg or neck and each day she would kill him.\n\nPedro did not have to consider the offer long, for he would pay any price to redeem his daughter. He set down the sharp glass. He shook the footballer\u2019s hand and let the mangy pup lick his wrist. His human form began to crumble away like sand pouring through an hourglass until he was just a swarm.\n\nAna Clara awoke the next morning to the sound of her daughter\u2019s wails. When she peered into the crib, she covered her mouth and began to shake. She ran her palm over the baby\u2019s head and face, which was as perfect as could be. She searched for Pedro to share the miracle with him, but he was nowhere to be found.\n\nIn time, it became common knowledge in the favela that Pedro had abandoned Ana Clara and the daughter he believed to be sickly. The suitors from Leblon began to return in all their finery to win Ana Clara over and, as before, she would show them the hourglass and the wooden box.  Except now, each time she did so, a single mosquito would seem to fly out of the box and land on her hand just where she had briefly worn Pedro's steel ring.  Without hesitating, Ana Clara would crush the insect in her palm.   "}, {"score": 5797, "prompt": " You are immortal, but no one knows.

Now? Not so much. \nThe reason, you ask? \nMy boss. \n\nThousands of years of watching humans struggle through life and answering to their superiors had granted me a lot of empathy for them, especially when they asked impossible things. I mean, I thought it had. Turns out what I was feeling was only sympathy. But now I understand. Now I feel the real effort it takes to appear bright, friendly and on the ball whilst a slimy, untrustworthy arrogant, bratty human adult saunters around as if he owns the place and he came up with all the ideas. \n\nI own this entire universe, mate, get off your high horse. \n\nI'm all powerful! I'm all freaking powerful! he does realise all these ideas are mine right? It was my idea to ditch the stylus on touch screen phones because fingers worked just as well! Heck, it was my idea for touch screens anyway! But I'm stuck answering the phone for complete imbeciles that can't even sign into their accounts. \n\n'Hey, listen up folks.' His nasal voice sent waves of anger down my spine, annoyance rushing through my body as his words hit my ears. Something in my hand cracked. I looked down, hoping it wasn't my computer mouse. \n\nIt was. \n\nSighing, I spun slightly on my chair and pushed the wireless mouse in the bin, before whisking open my desk drawer. It was completely full of identical white  replacement wireless computer mice. I picked one up without looking and began to sync it to my computer. \n\n'That means you too, Johnson.' \n\nI looked up, trying to keep my expression neutral. \n\n'If you keep it up with that attitude you'll be in for another disciplinary; we've been having a lot of complains about you from our customers. You're walking on a razor thin tightrope, Johnson. Don't think you're off the hook just because you've been here for a few years.' \n\nObviously my  expression still conveyed my absolute loathing. A few years? It's been at least ten. Smug bastard. \n\n'As you know, the next model is still in the planning stages, and as I'm one of the few members on the team I'll be quite busy for the next few months. I don't want any interruptions or anything; nothing is more important than this right now. Nothing you have to say or ask of me is more important than this. My ideas for previous models have been invaluable; I will not be breaking my track record. That is all.' \n\nHe puffed his chest up, looking over his employees as if he was a fantastic boss that had just given a fantastic speech as opposed to giving a shitty excuse for cutting his work load in half. \n\nHe left. I continued syncing my new mouse up, wondering what I would say to HR for breaking yet another one. They were already aware of my anger management issues. The anger was directed at the waste of space that I had the pleasure to call my boss. He hadn't come up with any of the ideas; he had casually asked me for advice in the staff room and stole my ideas. \n\nI'm not an idiot. I'm omnipotent, I'm all powerful, of course my ideas are the best. No one ever seemed to question what I said, I seemed to have an aura around me that compelled complete trust. \n\n\nThat's when it hit me. What could be the worst thing for the next model to have? What would he trust me with, take to a meeting, push through and ruin his reputation with? \n\nI opened my work emails and started to type out a message for him, gripping my new mouse this time with anticipation rather than anger. \n\n\n'I think, for the next IPhone, perhaps if we had no aux input....'\n\n\n\n*Edit: fixed a bunch of typos, and thank you to everyone for the amazing feedback*"}, {"author": "Inorai", "score": 5785, "prompt": " \"Jesus take the wheel, Satan get behind me, Buddha... man the .50 cal\"", "permalink": "/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7d6cjy/wp_jesus_take_the_wheel_satan_get_behind_me/dpvg1aj/", "body": "The three looked between each other.

It was the only real place for him, and there wasn't another option, when it came right down to it.  Buddha didn't fit behind the wheel, and they'd both seen Satan at work on that flask inside his jacket through the day.  No, Jesus would handle it.\n\nTheir wheels spun on the gravel.  The others were circling, now.  It was time.  The final battle, the final fight to see who would win the game once and for all.  Jesus and Satan teaming up was a given.  The other candidates had complained - it wasn't fair - but complaining got them nowhere.  \n\nThey all tried to pretend like they weren't going to do the exact same thing as soon as the opportunity presented itself.  They looked between each other edgily, sizing the competition up.  Picking teams.\n\nBuddha, on the other hand, was a surprise.  What incentive did *he* have for working together with the terrible twosome?  His smooth, expressionless face gave no hint of an answer as he clambered all the way up behind the gun mounted in the truck bed.  His bare feet were steady on the metal floor, perfectly centered even as his girth swung disconcertingly.  \n\n\"Here they come!\" Satan roared.  He had elected himself shot-caller, of course, even though they hadn't set teams.  Neither of the other two were surprised by *that*, either.  He'd always needed to have the last word on things.\n\nThe first contenders were approaching.  Muhammed was out front, leaning out the side door of a torn-up station wagon.  He clutched a rocket launcher in his hands.  They could see Shiva behind the wheel, grinning like a madcap as he spun the wheel.  The overburdened little car nearabouts rode up on two wheels as they whipped into a donut.\n\n\"Shoot!  Shoot!  Now, goddammit!  Why aren't you shooting yet?!\"  Satan screamed.  Jesus gritted his teeth, choosing to ignore the fact that his father's name was being taken in vain alongside him.  Buddha was just watching, sizing up the shot.  And then his meaty finger gripped the trigger.\n\nThe roar of the gun was deafening.  Satan clapped his hands over his ears, roaring with laughter as the gleaming, glowing rounds arced out towards the station wagon.  Shiva was swearing - they could see that much, even though his words were lost to distance and the racket.  But they were spinning too fast.  The ground between them erupted into shredded sand and mud.\n\nMuhammed wasn't waiting anymore.  A plume of fire shot from the rocket launcher.\n\nEverything happened all at once, after that.\n\n\"Satan!\"  Jesus cried.  He, too, was turning now, but there was only so much he could be expected to do.  He was supposed to be positioning them to attack.  Defending them was-\n\n\"I got it, I got it!  Don't get your robes in a bunch.\"  Satan hissed.  Defending them was *his* job.  He lurched dangerously in his seat, barely holding on.  But he pulled his hand up into an almost-level position, mimicking a gun.\n\n\"Bang.\"\n\nRed circles appeared endlessly around their truck.  Something was coming up from underground.\n\n\"*Damn* it, Satan.  Do you have to-\"\n\n\"Don't complain, big guy.  Left.  Left.  Go-\"\n\nThe truck whipped into a left-hand turn, narrowly avoiding the black pillars shooting up around them.  Jesus shook his head.\n\n\"I've *got it*.  Stop backseat driving.\"\n\nThe other teams were coalescing, now.  One after another, the deities were lining up for the big fight.  They all knew.  Whoever won this, would win the world.  And none of them wanted to lose.\n\nHe could almost see them, if he squinted.  Four sets of hooves, barely visible under the cloudline where they floated.  Watching.  Waiting.  The final fight, for whoever crushed the competition here.\n\nHe winced.  The little station wagon had just been slammed by a hummer.  He could see Ra through the front window, glowing faintly from the shit-eating grin on his face.  Oddly noodle-like tentacles were swarming out of the vehicle, attaching themselves to the station wagon.  Which seemed to be *vanishing* into the mass of pasta.\n\n\"Drive!  Drive!\"  Satan screamed in his ear.  The roar of the chaingun from the truck bed was almost a constant companion, now.  \n\nJesus grinned, flexing his hands on the wheel.\n\nAnd then he drove.\n\n(/r/inorai, critiques always welcome.

When he declared that nuclear war would be set off with a firing of a single bullet, he never realized that the foolish American pig-dogs would actually take him *literally*. When American Cavalry - not armored, but literal cavalry mounted on horseback, sporting plate armor and wielding lances that would be feared throughout North Korea - had thundered across the DMZ, his border units were caught so off-guard that they were almost immediately overrun. By the time poor Kim could rally the shocked military, the combined South Korean and American forces had already seized much of the region south of Pyongyang, and inspired by the knights in shining armor the local peasantry had revolted against the oppressive regime. Those few who attempted to resist were mercilessly cut down by the allied forces, whose numbers swelled by the day and who even now lay siege to Pyongyang.\n\nThe Chinese had not only condoned the invasion, they actually *participated in it*. While the West had rampaged through the lower half of True Korea, the Chinese had marched their own armies of antiquity into battle from the north, a terrifying force of both heavily armored infantry and rapid, Mongol-styled horsemen that served as advanced scouts and guerilla units, harassing the North Koreans with swarms of arrows before scurrying away from retaliation. It was an outright betrayal of Korea, but a stunning show of unity as the Chinese completed the encirclement of the now pitiful North Korea remnant, tied down to a single city with territory shrinking by the day.

He only used them on his military recruits to ensure their loyalty before allowing them to be armed in his presence.  Zord had been powerful, but the idea that he could keep thousands of people under his magic control on a daily basis...this Galarn guy really had no clue.

Weird tastes, Zord had refused to eat anything but organ meats and vegetables.  When Glenda had gotten too old to cook, I took over.  A few years later, Zord had taken a liking to me and I was in charge of most of his to day to day personal affairs.  Cooking his livers and kidneys, became pressing his robes, became scheduling his day.  Now he even had me in charge of hiring and firing for the castle.\n\nWhen I saw how Zord treated his girls, it was clear how my mom had disappeared.  Zord had instructed me to make two of his girls disappear in the shark pit.  Apparently, they had giggled in a way that he didn't like during one of their rendezvous.

I had warned them to get far away and never come back or I wouldn't be able to help them anymore.\n\nGalarn looked me up and down.  \"My good sir.  You are Zord's most trusted servant.

You can't kill Zord with just a sword.  He's not dead at all.  As soon as you struck him down he began to regenerate.  His phylactery is in the basement of this castle.  He's probably on his way back up here right now,\" I said.  \"Tomorrow night was the night.  He always drinks on Thursdays.  I was going to wait until he had finished his second bottle of wine and put everything into motion.  First the phylactery and then him.\"\n\nGalarn gasped and then tightened his breastplate.  \"Well then it is simple, we shall smite him down again.  Together my friend.  For the Kingdom.  For Avalon.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not.  Now that his body has reformed, the contraroot won't stop his magic.  He'll be invulnerable again.  You're not leaving here alive.

I'd been out one day, waiting for some friends at the park, as you do. I was eating a chocolate bar and apathetically tossed the wrapper aside. An old lady approached me. \n\n\"Don't you have any respect? Pick that up.\"\n\nNaturally I ignored her, being the lovely young man that I was until she screamed.\n\n\"Fine! Have it your way! If you shall litter the Earth, then I shall litter your mind.\"\n\nShe promptly left and I was confused, I assumed she was just a bit of an old bat. The wrapper blew away, and my friends turned up. We played some football, I was always fairly horrendous at that. \n\nThe next day, I woke up. For some reason the first thing I thought of was the old lady. I realised that it was fairly obnoxious for me to act that way to someone. Ah well, I'll probably never see her again anyway. I went downstairs and greeted my mother who has been a bit of a struggling single for a while now (I guess having an obnoxious teenage brat doesn't help much). There was a two, hovering above her head; cyan in colour. I wasn't really sure what it meant at the time. I knew that, objectively, this was strange. Intuitively, however, it felt oddly natural. So I went about my day.\n\nAs I went through school that day, I noticed everybody had the numbers. Notably my friend Tim who was a brown belt in karate had a blue four, our loud ex-military teacher who enjoyed startling sleeping students was a yellow six. The school bully was a turquoise three. Most students were a one or a two; shades of green. I could never see a number above my own head in reflections or anything like that, much to my frustration. \n\nWhen I watched TV I noticed that powerful people tended to have quite high numbers. The anchor had a five, the prime minister had a nine, some footage of an army doing a parade seemed to show a range from six to eight (a vibrant red).\n\nEventually, after having thought about this for a few weeks, I concluded that the number corresponded to danger. Being dangerous can mean many things. It can mean you're potent in a fight, or it can mean you have a lot of say socially. \n\nOne day, I was sitting in the park with my mother and some of her friends on a day out. She introduced me to someone new. Short, goatee, slicked back hair and an eight. He sat there, casually sipping on a can of lager. My mum introduced him as Sean, \"my new boyfriend.\"\n\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\nSo I couldn't control that little outburst, I must admit I panicked a bit. An eight is a member of the cabinet, a soldier, a serial murderer (What? The numbers come up on Crimewatch as well, you know). \n\nHe interjected, \"Haha! Relax kid. I'm going to be around for a while\" \n\nAt which point he leaned in and kissed my mum. This was not affection; this was dominance.\n\nIn the following days, I took my mum aside repeatedly to try to convince her to get out of this. She was, how can I put it? Thoroughly unwilling. So now I was anxious, I was frustrated. We were around Sean's house at the time. He came in later that day, bringing home some shopping, he bought me a chocolate bar. Well, that was nice? Thanks.\n\nSo it started out nicely enough. He could tell that I was anxious, and so he'd buy me little things to try to win my affections. To be honest, it started to work. My mum was in love with him and despite the red flags, I was honestly settling to the arrangement. What I hadn't noticed were the little things. At first it began as complaints; \"the jam isn't in the cupboard I said to put it in\", \"clean up that fucking cat shit\". Benign, but said with a sharp tongue.\n\nEventually he offered to fully support my mother. I'm not really sure how he was able to do this as he didn't have a job of which to speak, but it seemed to work out. My mum quit her job at the supermarket and now had much more free time to... \"do those fucking dishes,\" to \"make a doctor's appointment for me\". He spoke repeatedly of their sex life to me. Thanks for telling me. Over time his demands were shouting.\n\nMum's number dropped from a two to a one. Something was wrong.\n\nThis kind of behaviour carried on for a year. I was the frog in the pot.\n\nEventually he started doing things; hitting her when I wasn't around. I didn't notice of course, although I started to pick up the signs. Then one day I did. They had a huge argument. They were shouting, things were thrown. They wouldn't stop. The walls closed in. I had nowhere to go. In my right conscience, I had nowhere I could go. I was just as frightened as she was until that is I heard a crack; he headbutted her. Blood poured forth. I freaked the fuck out. I started screaming. I started crying. I had no idea what way was up. I briefly ran into the bathroom to try  to collect myself and figure out what the fuck I was supposed to do. I was scared. I was shaking. I was angry. I was livid. I was FURIOUS. And through the tears I saw the stained bathroom mirror. Everything was blurry but I saw it right there. Black as night, floating right above my own head. I could finally see it: Ten.\n\n\"Fuck them, fuck him, fuck everyone. Fuck this abusive piece of shit. I am taking control of this situation.\" \n\nIn that very briefly lucid state, I called an ambulance.\n\nI then broke the mirror, threw it at the ground. I picked the the largest shard of glass and looked at myself again. Ten. Definitely ten.\n\nI called down. \"Sean! Let's fucking talk!\"\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks so much for the comments, upvotes and especially those kind folk who gave me gold!

You hear me?\" I matched his intensity with my own. I wished I could transfer my strength onto him. Maybe I would, after all. \n\n\"Will it hurt?\" Danny asked, and licked his lips. They were cracked and white. I handed him a glass of water \n\n\"No, son. They won't hurt you.\" \n\n\"Not me. You.\" There was love and admiration in his tiny, sunken eyes. For the first time, it occurred to me that he may not be strong enough for what was to come. \n\n\"Me? Nah. I'll be fine. And when it's all over, I'll see your mother again. Do you have anything you want me to tell her for you?\" \n\n\"Tell her I love her, and miss her terribly. But I know one day we'll all be together again.

Why is my Master so sad now? What is going on? I scooted a little closer to him, licking his hand. Maybe licking his hand would make him feel better.\n\n\"Thank you, boy,\" my Master said, stroking my head. \"You've been a good boy so far. We've had some pretty fun times, too.

Everything was a blur, until I took off my glasses.  Did I always wear glasses?  Why would I have them?  I didn't need them.\n\n*Who am I?  How'd I get here?*\n\nI tried clearing my head.  The lingering effects of the pain quickly subsided, and I stood.  I was in the center of a grand hall.  Marble floors lay before me, with intricate murals depicting great battles with monsters and man alike.  The walls were adorned with weapons of every type; Each hung with care and easily accessible.  The pillars reached hundreds of feet up, and the thousands of candles hung from chandeliers from the vaulted ceiling.\n\nI had no memory of anything, and I knew I should be afraid.  Yet I felt only a steady calm.  Picking a direction, I began walking.  Perhaps I will run into someone.  Perhaps I'll find my own way out.\n\nI passed a shield that had been brightly shined to a mirror finish.  The mural on the wall depicted an athletic looking man using the shield to fight a monstrous woman with snakes for her hair.  Looking into the mirror, I caught a reflection of myself.  Skinny.  Slicked black hair cut short, but without regard for any style.  The marks on the bridge of my nose indicated a lifetime of wearing glasses.  Pocket protector in my breast pocket.  Two mechanical pencils and an eraser.  A Timex watch adorning my thin wrists.\n\nSeeing my reflection, a memory surged forward.  College.  I was coming out of a classroom when a beautiful girl with long brown hair asked me for help on her calculus homework.  I knew her.  I don't know how I knew her, only that there was a painful familiarity.\n\nI kept moving.  The next exhibit to catch my eye was a massive war-hammer.  The murals surrounding that depicted a warrior fighting off hordes of blue crystalline giants.  It was a beautiful weapon, and I instinctively reached out to touch it.\n\nMemory flashed before my eyes again.  I was in the hospital now.  That beautiful girl was crying.  Not in pain, in joy.  I was there with her, crying.  We were holding a healthy infant girl.  My daughter?  A voice was screaming in my head now, but I couldn't make it out.  There was something I needed to remember, but I couldn't dredge it forward.\n\nI forced myself to keep moving.  I saw an exquisite broadsword, embedded in the wall.  The murals depicted a beautiful and ethereal woman standing in the center of the lake, bequeathing the sword to a regal looking man.  I reached out to grab the pommel, bracing myself for the memories to come.\n\nI saw myself, sitting at a desk, being visited by a sympathetic policeman.  He was telling me that my daughter and wife had been killed.  I staggered for a bit, as the memory of that loss hit me in full.\n\nI remembered their names.  Alexandra.  Ava.  My wife.  My daughter.  I remembered everything about them.  Our lives together.  Watching Ava grow.  Making love to my wife.  Sweet sunsets spent together as a family at the dinner table.  Long road-trips filled with obnoxious sing-alongs.  Yet I could not remember my name.\n\nAnother weapon.  This time, a spear.  The murals showed an army of 300 facing against an impossibly large horde.  I recalled feverishly working every night, often going days without eating or sleeping.  I was driven.  Diving into paperwork.  Digging into stacks of records.  Always searching.  Again, my identity eluded me, lurking at the very cusp of consciousness.\n\nA sling and a heavy rock.  The murals depicted a slender young boy facing against an absolute giant of a man.  I remembered being in court.  My relentless search yielded fruit, and I was giving testimony.  The trial lasted for weeks, and in between court sessions, messages were delivered to me.  They alternated between promises of great wealth and of painful deaths.  I was driven, ignoring all entreaties and threats.  And finally, I was vindicated.  I nailed the ones responsible for the murder of my wife and child with tax evasion.\n\nI had reached the end of the hall.  And there stood before me a simple abacus.  A robust construction of wood and steel.  And I knew this was mine.  No murals surrounded it.  I reached out to grab it, and the last of the pieces fell into place.  I was beaten.  Tortured.  They kept me alive for weeks, as an example to others.  And through it all, I never once gave my torturers the satisfaction of crying out for mercy.\n\nI remembered my name.  I am Ted.

It was the old Henderson place, abandoned, broken down and creepy as always, but today someone had tied a red balloon to the doorknob. Malcolm turned to his brothers. \"What? The balloon? So what, we have hundreds of those? It's just a stupid balloon?\" \n\nReese smiled. \"Yeah, *my* balloon.\" \n\n\"No fair!\" Squeaked Dewey, \"I saw it first!\"\n\nFor half a second the three were paused, before all broke for the door and grabbed for the balloon as they got there. The rotten wood was no match for the three boys and it burst open, spilling them inside and busting the balloon on a splinter. \n\nDewey clutched the popped rubber and began to snivel. \"No fair, you didn't even *want* the balloon.\" \n\nIn as comforting way as he could, Reese leaned down and punched his little brother hard. \"Stop crying, look at this awesome house we've stumbled into!\" \n\nMalcolm had also been looking around. \"Yeah, it looks creepy, but in here it's just another old house. Hey! I bet we could have a party here and no one would even care! Then i could get all the cool kids to come and they might not think I was such a krelboyne.

It was a jolly tune, full of promises of joy and fun. Suddenly, a door, unseen before now, pushed open and another red balloon floated out. Dewey watched in surprise and stepped forward. \n\n\u201cHello there.\u201d Now closer, Dewey could see a pair of eyes staring out at him. \u201cWould you like a balloon little boy?\u201d \n\nDewey could now see that the balloon as held by a clown. \u201cYes please.\u201d \n\nThe Clown smiled. \u201cWould you like to come down here into the basement? If you do I have lots more balloons down here and they all float and dance. They *all* float down here.\u201d \n\nDewey reached forward and before the clown could react, he had grabbed the string. \u201cNo thanks, I just want the balloon.\u201d \n\nHe turned, but the voice returned. Soft and mocking. I\u2019ve got candy down here and comic books too. Dewey thought back to what his brothers had always told him. If someone offers you candy and comic books, go with them and bring some back. Shrugging he turned back and stepped through the door. \n\n*** \n\nReese had run deep into the house, looking for what he knew would be here somewhere, a load bearing wall. It had been weeks since he\u2019d caused any major havoc and if he could knock down a whole house that would be awesome. \n\nThe problem was, that no matter how far he went, none of the walls seemed to be the right one.  Each corner led to another thin plaster wall, but no load bearing ones to smash. Here he was, ready to destroy and he couldn\u2019t. \n\nOverwhelmed with anger and sorry he sank to his knees. \u201cWhy god, WHY ME?!\u201d \n\nA soft voice called to him from a door to one side. \u201cHello there little boy, would you like to come down here. There is lots to break and damage down here in the\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cHey, who are you?\u201d Reece looked closely. \u201cAre you a clown?

Slowly the door closed behind him. \n\n*** \n\nMalcom carefully mapped out the rooms, planning where each part of the party would be. For sure if he could get this right, he would be popular. It was only after a few minutes that he began to realise that his brothers were missing and more worryingly, silent. \n\n\u201cDewey? Reese?\u201d There was no reply and Malcolm felt a cold trickle of dread passing down his spine. \u201cAnyone?\u201d \n\nThere was a bang from the other room as the door smashed open and the cutting voice of his mother sliced through the air. \u201cYou boys are in *such* trouble when I find you.\u201d \n\nHe didn\u2019t know what it was about, but Malcolm knew from the tone that it was bad. Worse than when Frances had cut off Hal\u2019s hair, worse than when he himself had swapped his mother\u2019s face cream for butter. \n\nDesperate, he cast about for an escape and luckily saw one. The door in the far corner was open and he darted in, quickly slipping down the steps and pulling it shut behind him, all he needed to do was to hide for long enough for his mother to leave or find one of the others and he could slip away. \n\n***\n\nThe stairs went down and down and then suddenly, just as he began to wonder why they were so deep, he fell, landing on something soft. \n\n\u201cGet off me you idiot.\u201d It was his brother and he had landed on Reese\u2019s head. \n\nMalcolm stumbled up and saw both of his brothers were there, but the route back up was gone, broken stairs far above them and impossible to reach. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting cotton candy!\u201d Cried Dewey and moved to go forward, but Malcolm grabbed him.\n\n\u201cMom is *right* behind me, she followed us here and\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cIT\u2019S MOM!\u201d  The other two screamed and ran into each other. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here, right now!\u201d Reese demanded. \n\nFrom the corner, out of the darkness came a soft voice. \u201cOh, but you can, you can come with me!\u201d \n\n\u201cMr Clowney!\u201d Dewey cried. The other two looked on as the old fashioned clown moved from the gloom. \u201cI call him Mr Clowney and he\u2019s my friend.\u201d \n\nMalcom and Reese were looking a little more closely at the figure, who had smiled and shown off row after row of razor teeth. \u201cUh, I think we\u2019ve got to go Dewey, like *right now*.\u201d \n\nReese grabbed his arm and span and the three shot into the darkness, pushing past boxes and crates that had been stored there for years. Behind them the clown advanced, its smile now split into a horrific grimace as it advanced slowly, keeping the boys in sight. \n\nThey pushed forward, trying to run, but this basement was so full it was impossible and they crashed into things, trying to keep an eye behind them as it grew closer, larger and more terrifying. It laughed softly, mockingly, as it enjoyed the pursuit, enjoyed softening them up. \n\nAt last the boys found the wall and there was nowhere more to go. The clown paused, ready for its moment, ready for its glory, ready to\u2026\n\n\u201cTHERE YOU BOYS ARE\u201d\n\nLois burst past the last few boxes and grabbed the ear of her nearest son, yanking Reese almost off his feet. \u201cYOU LITTLE HORROR, YOU MONSTER!\u201d \n\nAll three boys screamed in terror and relief. Malcolm grabbed his mother\u2019s leg and sobbed happily. \u201cHow did you find us?!\u201d \n\nLois looked down in puzzlement. For once the boys seemed almost *happy* to have been found. \u201cYou left a trail of vandalised cars leading right to the door, which you *also* broke. This is the Kellerman place, in fact they used to do day-care here, before you boys\u2026 well, before you.\u201d\n\nLois looked about, the basement suddenly seemed less threatening. The boxes were play equipment and everything you would need to run a day care. \u201cNow, you boys have a lot to answer for, you are coming with ME!\u201d \n\nShe dragged them up and out of the basement, away from the terrors below and into the light. In the darkness IT watched them leave. IT knew fear, IT *consumed* fear, but even IT knew when it was in the presence of a master. \n\n***\n\nAh crud, i always forget to say that I have a personal sub /r/fringly - it's a a bit neglected, but you should float on over and take a look. \n"}, {"author": "jacktherambler", "score": 5401, "prompt": " A group of fantasy adventures has one of their members replaced by a Doppelganger.

I loaded the tray with Margaret's favorite breakfast foods and brought them to her in bed. The wood floor of our old house creaked as I entered the room, causing her to stir under the sheets. Still half-asleep, she gave a blissful smile at the smell of the food. \n\nShe sat up against a wall of pillows and I set the tray in her lap. \"Today's the day,\" I reminded her, brushing a few stray strands of hair out of her eyes. She still looked exactly the same after all these years.\n\n\"I know.\" She took a bite of her English muffin, and a gob of jam clung to her upper lip. It was adorable. But the smile that came across my lips was more painful than anything I'd ever felt.\n\nWe had chosen to die today. It was a decision several centuries in the making, but the time had come. Nearly all of our friends had long since made the choice to end their lives, but we'd held out. Gentle pushing from our children, and our grandchildren, and our great-great-great-great-great grandchildren had become not so gentle in recent years. We resisted even at the cost of becoming social pariahs. Some of our more ungrateful descendants were even threatening to have our assets seized, claiming that we'd delayed their inheritance for too long. *Brats*. Finally Margaret and I relented, and scheduled our termination date. Today. \n\nI took a slice of bacon off her plate and bit into it. I'd certainly miss bacon. There would be a lot of that today: my last everything. Last bite of bacon. Last shower. Last walk with our dog Fisher, who would go stay with our great-great-granddaughter and her family after we passed on.  \n\nMargaret and I decided to make a day of it. If it was to be our last, it was to be our *best*. We started with a long drive through the forest, like the ones we'd taken when we first fell in love. Dappled sunlight filtered through the dense green leaves of the canopy, and a warm breeze shook the branches. Then we arrived at the lake and dug our old toes into the sandy beach at the shore. Cold water lapped at our feet, sending chills racing up our bodies. Rather than shrink from it, I dove headfirst into the water. It was cool and refreshing against the summer heat. Margaret followed me in, emerging a few seconds later with rivulets running from her hair. At shoulder depth, we embraced and kissed. Just like when we'd first started dating. \n\nThe sun began to dip behind the trees, painting the sky red and orange. We dried off on the dock and drove to Palmero's for dinner. It had long since gone out of business, and some other restaurant was there in its place. But the dining patio was still open, and we managed to get a table in the very same place that we had hundreds of years ago when I'd first dropped to one knee and placed a diamond ring on Margaret's finger. Over dinner, we reminisced about all of those good times. We were both deliberately ignoring our watches as our appointment grew ever closer. \n\nFinally we couldn't avoid it anymore. Goodbye messages from our family and few remaining friends began rolling in. \"Best of luck!\" they said, as though we were departing for a long journey instead of fading into oblivion. Though filled with loving language, all I could read from the messages was 'you can't back out now!'\n\nMargaret and I got back into the car and headed down the highway to the doctor's office where we'd end our lives. The sign loomed over the highway, pointing the way toward the end. I'd been reading up on the subject recently, and most people only described relief as the end neared. Like climbing into a warm bed at the end of a long day. But I didn't feel that at all. It felt like I'd swallowed a load of molten lead. But I had to stay firm for Margaret. We'd agreed that we were in this together, and I wasn't about to let her down now. \n\n\"I had a great day,\" she told me, giving my hand a squeeze. \n\n\"Me too.\" The turn was coming closer and closer. Neither of us wanted to say what the other was thinking.\n\n\"You know, we forgot dessert,\" she finally told me. \"We used to always go out for ice cream.\"\n\nI gave a giddy laugh. I've never felt such relief. \"You know, you're right. One can't die without a proper dessert.\"\n\nShe beamed back. \"Well I guess we'll have to reschedule!\" \n\nWe sped by the exit toward the doctor's. The lights were still on in the office, but there was no one else in the parking lot. I wondered briefly how long they'd wait for us before realizing that we'd decided not to show. \n\n----\n\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" Margaret said firmly with a sundae in her hand.  \"We'll reschedule for tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Right.\" I licked my ice cream cone.

He couldn't let her see how happy he really was, it'd break her heart. \n\nArtillerella had come around around at a hard time in Confoudus' life, a time when he found himself struggling for purpose, being a terrifying being that the entire world feared had really grown rather boring. He found himself watching \"*A Hero Emerges, the Hero Academy Inside Story*\" on TV more and more over the years, looking at the new blood, hoping against hope that finally there'd be someone to challenge him. But every time someone looked promising: Cyclonia, Septeroid, even that overhyped windbag Heatwave, they always ended up the same: cocky, drug-addled layabouts who just went for the easy, weak villains, posed for some newspaper photos and backed down the second any villain worth their salt made a challenge.\n\nThen came Artillerella. She wasn't particularly strong, her only power other than the standard flight, enhanced reflexes etc. was her ability to create meteor-like orbs between her hands and hurl them at her opponents. They exploded with an impressive flash, and looked dazzling to watch, but unfortunately they took a long time to charge, were easy to dodge and really weren't all that useful in actual combat.\n\nNevertheless she'd captivated Confoundus, she was brave. While Heatwave and his gang of celebrity hangers on partied in a nightclub, she challenged Arachniarch, a villain at least five times her strength, as he threatened to unleash his horde of spiders on an orphanage. \n\nOf course she lost the fight, but she'd fought valiantly, and Confoundus was disheartened to see Heatwave wipe the cocaine off his nose and fly in at the last moment to nab the glory, barely managing to defeat the significantly weakened Arachniarch. Artillerella wasn't even mentioned in the news article the next day.\n\nHe fell in love with her. Her coy smile, her little blowing-smoke-off-the-gun victory move, the way she fought with such passion in battle. She was everything he'd ever dreamed of. And so one day, the long-feared return of Confoundus came, it had been oh-so-satisfying to smack down the pompous upstarts that had risen to international fame as the so-called strongest heroes. He beat the best, then the second best, and before long all the remaining heroes cowered in fear. \n\nAll but one, Artillerella. \n\nOf course Confoundus could have snapped her mind in two in an instant with his psychic powers, but when he looked at that determined grimace framed by that wavy red hair, he just... couldn't bring himself to do it. \n\n\"NO, how can this BE?\" he'd said, theatrically.\n\n\"My powers\" Confoundus had continued, waving his arms like a madman\n\n\"Your will, it's too strong, my powers can't touch you...\" \n\nAnd that was when the inferno bomb hit him. Such sweet pain, the burning fury of such a sweet honest soul coalesced into a scorching, searing agony that only he could love. He wanted it again and again. \n\nAnd so he escaped from prison, and so she, again, \"defeated\" him. And again. And again and again and again.\n\nThis was capture number... nine? Confoundus was pretty sure. \n\n\"Best one yet\" he thought to himself \"she's honest to goodness putting up a fight now, might be one day I don't have to fake it anymore.\n\nHis daydream was shattered.\n\n\"Confoundus, you pathetic old shite\" a self-superior sounding British voice yelled from above him.\n\n\"I've never liked you if I'm honest, but lucky for you we're on the same team, so I'll help you out of this one.\"\n\nShimmer. A pompous villain who carried two daggers and had the ability to move with astounding speed, even for someone with powers.\n\n\"Shimmer!\" Artillerella's melodic yet firm voice called, as she flew over to protect the police officers escorting Confoundus away.\n\n\"Get out of here, or do you want a visit to the burn ward, too?\"\n\nShimmer laughed.\n\n\"The burn ward? Oh come on. Maybe I'd have let it slide if I hadn't just heard that *exact* line from Pyrogladiator yesterday. Every fire hero's been using that one, for decades. Seriously, you're a rookie, let Confoundus go and maybe I won't slash you up too badly.\" Shimmer said threateningly, holding one of his daggers up to the light.\n\n\"Don't know if you've noticed\" Artillerella said with a smile \n\n\"But my arrest profile doesn't exactly seem too 'rookie' to me. A few years ago even you would be running away from Confoundus, and now I've got him wrapped around my little finger.\" there was that coy smile Confoundus loved so much.\n\n\"Now do what you do best, Shimmer\" Artillerella said confidently \n\n\"And run on home\"\n\n\"OK that's it\" Shimmer said, turning to Confoundus.\n\n\"Seriously? You let *her* take you down? Have you heard these lines? Is it possible to kill yourself with psychic powers? Because if I were you I would have tried by now.\"\n\n\"Enough!\" Artillerella yelled, as a glowing sphere lit up between her hands. \n\nNobody even saw the next move, Shimmer flashed through the air around the orb and slashed at Artillerella with his dagger. \n\nArtillerella was by no means a weak hero, but Shimmer was probably the third or fourth most powerful villain in the world, even Confoundus himself wouldn't have found him to be an easy win.\n\nBlood spattered across the pavement and Artillerella fell from the sky. Confoundus felt tears form in his eyes as he heard her body thump against the ground, and half-heard some witty retort from Shimmer before he sped away. \n\n\"My love\" Confoundus said, his voice cracking.\n\n\"My love why did he do this... why?\"\n\nThe police had long since fled when Shimmer showed up, and so no-one was there to watch Confoundus weep as Artillerella's blood seeped out onto the pavement. \n\nEDIT: I'm very glad people liked this so much, I'll begin writing the continuation immediately after I finish this edit.

It was more of a camp, spread over acres and acres of lush forest. There was a white sandy beach (nude, of course) full of copulating couples. There were little cabins sprinkled all along the path, from which orgasmic moans regularly came belting out. Men with six pack abs and women with perky breasts strolled by without even noticing me and God. They only had eyes for each other, tickling and pinching each other with flirtatious giggles. \n\n\"What do you think?\" God asked as we passed a nineteen-way taking place in a pool of champagne. Little cherubs flitted overhead armed with mops and cleaning supplies, thankfully. \"Lust is our most popular sin.\" I eyed the supermodel-like figures of a couple passing nearby, and could easily see why. \"You can look however you want. Hell, you can be whatever gender you want. No fetish is too taboo, and no desire can be denied here.\"\n\nIt was *quite* tempting, but I wasn't ready to make a permanent decision here. \"Let's see the others,\" I told God.\n\nWe carried on to Greed. We passed rows and rows of mansions, each more opulent than the next. Some of them were so large that they would have had enough bed rooms to fit my entire hometown. And so many different styles: one second, we were in a beautiful French vineyard in front of a gorgeous chateau with the Alps in the background. The next second, a warm tropical beach with a modern mansion atop breathtaking cliffs. After that, a ski chalet in Colorado with a roaring fire in a hearth large enough to fit an ox. Each one had various Italian sports cars and Rolls Royces parked in front, with the occasional smattering of boats, helicopters, etc. \n\n\"Any material desire you ever wanted,\" God explained. \"Your own world, where you can have everything. You want the Hope Diamond? You can fly to Washington DC in your own solid gold helicopter and buy it from the Smithsonian. Hell, you can just *buy* the Smithsonian.\"\n\nAlso tempting, but I decided to keep looking. \n\nGluttony was next up. Tables and tables of the very finest foods: beautiful steaks cooked medium rare; butter-poached lobster tail; fresh oysters on a half shell; exotic wines in dusty bottles that had been hiding in the cellars of the world's finest restaurants. Everyone had a glass of champagne in hand and simply lounged on couches and chairs near the tables, eating endlessly. As soon as the inhabitants took a bite, the food just instantly came back. My mouth watered even *watching* them.\n\n\"In every other House, the food is practically *sawdust* compared to Gluttony,\" God explained. \"You haven't truly experienced heaven until you've been to Gluttony.\"\n\nI shook my head, and we kept moving. \n\nSloth was as you'd expect. An endless sea of the softest mattresses, stacked with cushions and pillows that made the story of the princess and the pea seem minimalist. Little angels visited each resident, giving them massages that made them all melt into their blankets. \n\nWrath was... well, a lot like what I'd expect Hell to be like. Fire, brimstone, whips, torture.. you know, the works. Except here, you weren't the one being tortured. Every enemy you'd ever made in your real life was now under your thumb. \"Lots of people choose their fathers,\" God explained. \"Lots of grudges against parents in general, you know. But you're not limited to that. Someone beat you out for a big promotion back on Earth? Take your pound of flesh here.\"\n\nThen we arrived at Envy. It looked... well, a lot like home. \n\n\"Go on in,\" God said, gesturing toward the door. I turned the knob and walked in... and found Emily waiting inside. She ran forward, wrapped her arms around my neck, and planted a kiss right on my lips. \"Welcome home, honey.\"\n\nI looked back toward God. \"Oh, don't be coy,\" he said. \"You have no secrets from me. We all know that you were in love with your best friend's wife.\" She didn't seem to hear him at all; she went back into the hall. \"We all know that you just *settled* for your own wife while secretly pining after her. Well, this is your chance to live happily ever after.\"\n\nI peered into the kitchen. Emily was baking something, wearing nothing but an apron. Her curly black hair fell softly over her shoulder as she whisked ingredients. She turned back, noticed I was observing her, and an enthusiastic smile spread across her face. \n\n\"It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?\" God whispered in my ear. \n\nI wanted to take it. God *damn* did I want to take it. But I shook my head.\n\nGod seemed puzzled. \"You need to make a decision,\" he told me. \n\n\"I haven't seen Pride yet.\"\n\nHe scoffed. \"No one ever wants Pride, trust me.\"\n\n\"Well, I want to see it.\"\n\n----\n\nPride was boring. Just a row of workbenches in a bare white room.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" I told God.\n\n\"Yeah, no one does,\" he answered. \"That's why no one ever chooses it. Doesn't cavorting in Lust sound better than sitting here building little trinkets for the rest of eternity? Wouldn't you rather gorge yourself in Gluttony? Or spend time with Emily in Envy?\"\n\nI considered the options again. \"I pick Pride,\" I finally told him. \n\nHe narrowed his eyes. \"*What?* Look at it!\" He gestured around the room again. There wasn't much to look at. \"Why would you choose *this* for the rest of time?\"\n\n\"Because you *don't* want me to pick it,\" I told him. If he was really God, he'd know what a contrarian I can be. And I knew he was hiding something, trying to pretend like Pride didn't exist. There was something special about it.\n\nGod scowled back. \"Fine.\" He led me over to one of the workbenches. In the center, there was a black space. A blank, empty void that went on forever. \"Here's your universe,\" he said. \"You've got seven days to get started.\" He took his seat at the bench next to me and went back to tinkering in his own world.

A long, red cape flowed past a soft, furry body. A steel helmet sat atop his head. Two soft ears poked out of holes in the helmet. A sword rattled against his hips. A great chorus of cheers and salutations followed Sir Mittens as he walked out of the castle. He strode, proud, into the thick forest which ringed the castle. The King and his court watched from balconies up high. Pride swelled in their chests.\n\nThe forest came up to meet Sir Mittens. The dense overgrowth soon surrounded the noble kitten. The cheers of the castle died down as the thicket grew ever denser around Sir Mittens. The brave kitty was soon surrounded by the peaceful quiet of the forest. Birds chirped, leaves rustled, insects cricked and frogs croaked. A soft stream babbled somewhere nearby.\n\nThe ground beneath Sir Mittens soft, pink paws started to slope upwards. With an adorable, and very scratchable chin held high, Sir Mittens walked. The slope broke out of the dense forest, and Sir Mittens ascended the incline.\n\nThe slope left behind the thick green of the forest. Sir Mittens was quickly surrounded by rocky mountains and spires. He climbed, agile and patient, up the mountain. Above him, a great cavern was carved into the mountainside. Sir Mittens saw the mouth of the cave, and narrowed his eyes. His paws moved expertly as he traversed the rocky slope. His goal was in sight.\n\nReaching a pink paw up in the air, Sir Mittens grabbed the lip of the cave. He pulled himself up, and soon stood at the edge of this mountain cavern. The midday sun beat into the cave, illuminating it. Just on the edge of his vision, Sir Mittens could see glittering piles of gold and treasure.\n\nSir Mittens took several careful steps into the cave. His tail swished softly behind him as he stalked forward. From within the cave, Sir Mittens could hear a breathing. A great, hot gust of air blew past Sir Mittens.\n\nSuddenly, the ground started to shake beneath Sir Mittens\u2019 paws. Deep within the cave, there was a tremendous rustling. Sir Mittens spread his hind legs out, and readied himself. He felt the impact of massive, taloned feet approaching him from within the dark.\n\nA great, scaly head appeared before Sir Mittens. A giant bearded dragon, easily towering over Sir Mittens\u2019 feline form, emerged from the depths of the cave. It stood in front of Sir Mittens, and let out a great roar.\n\nSir Mittens stared up at the bearded dragon. The two creatures locked eyes. A smile spread across the bearded dragon\u2019s reptilian face. The great lizard laid on its belly, and extended its head out towards Sir Mittens. Sir Mittens padded towards the lizard, and raised a paw.\n\nWith the softest of pats, Sir Mittens petted the giant bearded dragon. The bearded dragon purred softly.\n\n\u201cKing Meow sends me, Sir Mittens, to give you a message, Oh Great One.\u201d Sir Mittens said softly to the lizard.\n\nThe bearded dragon continued to purr contentedly as Sir Mittens\u2019 continued to pet its head. Sir Mittens leaned his head in towards the lizard\u2019s ear. He was so close that some of his whiskers touched the reptile\u2019s scales. He whispered quietly.\n\n\u201cThe King says you\u2019re a good boy/\u201c\n\nThe bearded dragon let out a satisfied purr, and Sir Mittens wrapped his soft arms around the dragon\u2019s neck, embracing the great beast in an act of friendship and loving respect.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nHope you enjoyed the story!

I never used to give too much thought to the afterlife, but I always thought I was a decent person.  I was faithful to my wife, friendly to my neighbors, a volunteer at the soup kitchen on weekends.  I didn\u2019t commit any crimes (beyond the occasional speeding ticket) or cheat on my taxes.  I smiled a lot, and I went to church occasionally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really your fault, sir,\u201d my orientation imp, Ashrax, consoled me.  \u201cHimself Above is just crazy about that \u2018no-shellfish\u2019 thing.  Used to be, like, three books of the Bible, but one of your popes cut it for brevity, and I guess people stopped paying attention to it.\u201d  The imp wrinkled its nose.  \u201cI\u2019d say about four-fifths of the people here are in for shellfish.  Always seemed kind of excessive to me.  I wonder if Himself is allergic.\u201d\n\nWe were walking down Brimstone Ave., Hell\u2019s main drag.  Once you got past the wailing, the over-use of fire as a thematic element, and the constant smell of sulfur (\u201cmillennia of farts trapped down here,\u201d Ashrax said with a wink), Hell was\u2026 surprisingly normal.  Earlier, when I had expressed surprise that the check-in demons used iPads, Ashrax just shrugged.  \u201cSteve Jobs parked in a lot of handicapped spaces, sir.\u201d\n\nUp ahead, I saw a dark, Gothic mansion perched on a black volcanic hill, overlooking a classical lake of fire.  Admiring the wrought iron gates depicting the murder of nonbelievers, I asked Ashrax who lived there.  \u201cUsed to be Satan, of course.  Great parties here.  Once a month the damned would get together and roast one of the gluttonous on a spit, which is great because unfortunately the food here is pretty bad, sir.\u201d  Seeing my face, the imp hurried on.  \u201cUmm.   Right.  Sorry.  I forgot you\u2019re new.  Anyway, he lost his house when the suffering bubble dried up after the financial crisis, so as of today, Satan\u2019s being kicked out.\u201d\n\n\u201cSatan was *kicked out*?  By who, God?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d  Ashrax smiled impishly.  \u201cBy you.\u201d \n\n* * * * *\n\nThat night \u2013 or what passed for night in a dark, timeless cavern \u2013 Ashrax arranged a Life Viewing in my private theater to explain things.  A few of the house demons I had met attended as well.  There was the butler, Snooj, a prim satyr; Corthrax, my imp driver (no relation, Ashrax assured me); and the pool boy, Gorfu, a 12-foot golem comprised of molten magma.\n\n\u201cI still feel like there must have been some kind of mistake,\u201d I said for at least the fourth time.  \u201cI was pretty happy in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you were, sir.\u201d  Snooj clapped me on the back.  \u201cOf course you were.\u201d  He signaled to Gorfu, who used his huge fist to start the projector and, inadvertently, several fires.  \n\nI watched, dumbstruck, as a seemingly alternate version of my life played out before me.   I saw myself as a baby, playing in the crib just like in our home movies\u2026 while my parents, drunk and belligerent, screamed at each other.  \u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d I said quickly, as my mom broke a beer bottle on my crib and lunged for my dad\u2019s throat.  \n\nI always wondered where that scar on dad\u2019s neck came from.\n\nI saw myself, age five, playing with chemicals I found in the garage.  I watched, powerless, as five year old me drank a tall glass of\u2026 something.  \u201cAntifreeze, sir,\u201d Snooj said, clicking his hoofs together sympathetically.  \u201cThat\u2019s why you were bad at math.\u201d\n\nI saw an endless string of humiliating rejections and failures as an adolescent. Girls avoiding me, friends making faces at me behind my back, my little league baseball team telling me the wrong time for the start of the playoff game.  A lot of Fs in math.  It all culminated in Michelle Adams\u2019s dumping me at a Valentine\u2019s Day dance for \u2013 in her words \u2013 \u201cliterally anybody else in the world.\u201d \n\nThen she punched me in the stomach and stole my wallet.  I had forgotten about that part.\n\nThrough it all, the version of myself I saw on the screen was amazingly resilient.  *Or maybe just oblivious*, I amended, watching myself walk down the street reading a book as my sister shot at me \u2013 and missed \u2013 with a high-powered rifle.  \u201cYou\u2019ll never collect the insurance money that way,\u201d my dad said, but his aim wasn\u2019t any better. \n\nOn-screen, I whistled as I went along my way.\n\nThe hits just kept coming.  There were gasps as my soon-to-be-wife showed up late to the ceremony because she had to fix her hair - after banging the groomsmen in the back room. *All of them*.  Feeling a lump in my throat, I stepped outside to take a break.  Gorfu was blubbering, great huge tears of fire that burned holes in the floor, while Ashrax and Corthrax gleefully took bets on what, or who, would eventually kill me.\n\nApparently, there was nobody in my life who had actually liked me for me.  I counted twelve con artists (each successful), eleven attempts on my life for insurance money, and fifty-one viral Youtube videos in which I was, in some way, \u201cthe mark.\u201d  At best, people had pitied me.\n\nOutside on the veranda, I took a deep breath and looked out over the artfully arranged corpses in the Fields of the Damned.  \u201cSorry you had to see that, sir,\u201d Ashrax said.  \u201cLooks like you really suffered.\u201d  I nodded, numbly.  I hadn\u2019t realized it at the time, but I had indeed suffered.\n\n\u201cYou know, sir\u2026\u201d Ashrax hesitated, then plunged ahead, \u201cit\u2019s possible for someone with enough resources Below to have some influence back there.  In the first world.  Nothing so great as here, of course,\u201d he gestured out over the field of corpses, \u201cbut you can send bad luck, pestilence, that sort of thing.\u201d\n\nA new feeling was starting to arise within me, filling the empty void.   \u201cI can do that with my suffering?\u201d  I asked, looking out over the lake of fire.\n\nAshrax nodded.  \u201cYou have about as much as we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d  Quietly, he added, \u201cGorfu in there would probably help for free.\u201d\n\nI looked inside and saw my final moments reflected on the projector screen, my hands and ankles tied as my house burned down around me, my wife and children toasting my death outside.  I saw their fancy new house, their new husband, their new father.\n\nI turned back to Ashrax, my eyes now dancing with a fire entirely of their own.  I smiled, a cold, dark smile.  \u201cTell me more.\u201d\n\nEdit:  I wrote a [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4wh8c7/wp_suffering_is_a_form_of_currency_in_hell_the/d67kxyx) and [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4wh8c7/wp_suffering_is_a_form_of_currency_in_hell_the/d67l0s4).

I have never written anything for this sub as I'm not a writer, but saw the prompt on my front page, and started crying. I hope it's okay if I share this with you.\n\nMy mom turned 71 years old last November. The day before she was working out at the gym as she did five days a week. You wouldn't have known she was in her seventies; she had few wrinkles, and still worked full-time for the local school system as an administrative assistant. She was standing up after cycling 8 miles on the gym bike when she had a seizure. A fitness instructor called 911. The hospital called me, and I rushed to the emergency room.\n\nMy mom was already hooked up to monitors and an oxygen mask when I arrived. She was not awake. The ER doctor told me that she appeared to be in a coma and was exhibiting neurological symptoms. They wheeled her into the MRI bay and ran a scan of her brain. Cloudy disperse formations showed covering a third of her frontal lobes. A small mass shone bright under contrast in a portion of her inner brain. The neurologist explained that they needed to remove a sample of brain tissue to test for cancer.\n\nMy mom never woke up. She was diagnosed with glioblastoma stage IV, along with an unusual form of brain cancer that creeps between tissue, locking down brain and body function like a slow-moving night janitor. She was released to hospice care, and I spent the next three months sitting next to her silent body, 24 hours a day, reading her stories and bits from the news. Sometimes I sang to her, her favorite country songs though I can't carry a tune. She passed in the middle of the night a few weeks ago, and I didn't notice until I woke from a fitful sleep to find her cold and still.\n\nThe day after her obituary posted online, I started receiving calls and messages from literally hundreds of strangers. They wanted to know if they could attend the funeral mass, or if they could send flowers and make a donation in her name to foundations supporting brain cancer research. Who were these people? My mom had a few friends, but mostly hung out with me when she was outside of work. \n\nIt ends up that my mom had a secret. She had a Twitter account, and had over 50,000 followers. She didn't post funny things or salacious things or political things - the stuff that usually goes viral. She just posted coffee talks each morning, and tens of thousands of men and women around the entire world joined her in wishing others a great day. She liked to post motivational pictures with sunsets and uplifting words. She liked photos of deer in the woods, kittens, the great expanse of desert that rolls beyond our city, the stars of the night sky. \n\nShe never told me about her Twitter. I found out from these strangers who came to depend on her smile and spirit. I guess what I learned is that it doesn't take much to make someone else's life better.\n\nThanks for listening.

Well, it wasn't must mine - a few other young men and women were born twenty-one years ago today.  We had that in common, along with the creeping dread about our titles.  \n\nEvery person, upon turning twenty-one, was granted a title.  It was supposed to reflect the greatest accomplishment of your youth - to give you something to reflect on as you grew, and a bar to exceed as you built a life.  It was a tradition left over from a very long time ago, when we considered people adults at thirteen, and twenty-one was something like middle age.  As the world got more complicated, and safer as well, the twenty-one year old villagers were barely adults.  We'd had precious little chance to accomplish anything, and the titles were becoming something else - even shameful, in some cases.  \n\nI watched as the line moved forward.  The Oracle, Glenda:Devourer of Fifty-Three-Chicken-Nuggets-In-A-Single-Sitting, took each youth by the hands, and stared into their eyes.  Then, in a voice not quite her own, she announced the new title.\n\nJennifer, four spaces ahead of me in line, had performed CPR on her uncle when he'd had a heart attack.  She was named \"Jennifer:Who-Saved-A-Dying-Man\".\n\nHarold, three spaces a head of me was not so lucky.  I had no idea what his title was going to be, and I wanted to weep for him when I heard her announce, \"Harold: Best-At-Masturbation\".  No one spoke, there were no jeers or sniggers.  All who were older had stood there fearing something similar, and all who were younger feared it for themselves.  \n\nTwo spaces ahead was John, who was given the enviable title, \"John:Strongest In His School\".   There was much cheering here.  No one would jeer a strange, or pathetic title, but many would congratulate a commendable one. \n\nThe saddest case was right in front of me.  Alan.  Poor Alan, who had the worst luck.  I don't just mean the title - I mean his life, which led up to his title, \"Alan:Survivor-Against-Long-Odds\".  If anything bad could happen, it happened to Alan.  The illnesses, the accidents.  Which were almost as bad as the 'accidents'.  His parents had been real angels (before they'd had an accident of their own, and gone there), but not the kind you'd find in Heaven.  Things had gotten better for Alan after that, and he'd gone to live with his Aunt.  He had fewer bruises and 'fell down' far less often these days, but he still tended to flinch at a loud noise.  It's a small village, everyone knew what was going on, and pretended they didn't.  I had half hoped someone would get the title, 'Most-Self-Deluded'.  \n\nI knew all about Alan and had guessed roughly what his title would be. and I knew what my title was going to be too.  It was pretty easy to guess, if you had actually accomplished something - few of us had more than one significant accomplishment.  I had been dreading this for three years.  I even thought about running.  I thought of refusing the Ceremony, and enduring the ostracism that would result.  I though of running a way to another village or town, and lying about my title, or pretending to be from one of the growing number of places that had discarded the practice altogether.  \n\nI thought about it, but I didn't do it.  Instead, I walked toward Glenda, who was a beautiful woman these days, despite the implied gluttony of her title. I walked past Alan and his now-permanently-memorialized tragedy, past John and his superlative.  I marched resolutely past poor Harold, who would never live this down, and past Jennifer, the only one of us with a title really worth having.  \n\nI put my hands in Glenda's, and met her eyes, and felt her look into me.
